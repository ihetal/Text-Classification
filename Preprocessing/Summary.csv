Last night on CBS “60 Minutes,” Steve Kroft interviewed author Michael Lewis about his new book, ""Flash Boys."" Lewis alleges that the U.S. stock market is ""rigged…by a combination of stock exchanges, the big Wall Street banks and high frequency traders.” Lewis contends that the exchanges and regulators allow high frequency traders to front run orders, meaning that they are able to buy in front of you and sell them back to you when you want to buy.

Kroft: Is this illegal?

Lewis: No. That’s the thing that’s so shocking about all this. It should…

Kroft: Well you used the word front running. Front running’s illegal.

Lewis: This form of front running is legal. It’s legalized front running. It’s crazy that it’s legal for some people to get advance news on prices and what investors are doing. It’s just nuts. Shouldn’t happen.

As CNBC’s Bob Pisani notes, the 60 Minutes interview “did not bring up the hottest topic around high-speed trading: “that high-speed traders have access to a ‘proprietary feed’ that allows them to have a trading advantage over those who rely on the ‘public feed.’ There is indeed a 'proprietary feed' which has been provided to anyone willing to pay for it, with the blessing of the SEC, for many years.”

While none of this seems fair, it does not amount to much money to you or me. Although I think Michael Lewis is a terrific author and a great storyteller, after the segment, one thought ran through my mind: WE HAVE BIGGER FISH TO FRY! Retail investors don’t like the idea of the big guys getting an edge, but that seems like chump-change compared to the financial service industry’s reluctance to adopt the fiduciary standard, a set of core principles which would require financial professionals to put the interests of their clients first. Those who aren't fiduciaries (brokers, insurance salespeople) are held to a less rigorous standard, called ""suitability."" That means anything they sell to customers must be appropriate for them, though not necessarily in their best interest.

Two years ago, when I interviewed then-SEC Chair Mary Schapiro, she noted that the industry reluctance to adopt a clear fiduciary standard ""puts investors in a terrible situation, where they are forced to parse out complicated legal concepts."" Schapiro supported the fiduciary standard, but the industry has fought hard to water down the definition in the name of preserving ""customer choice of and access to financial products and services."" Translation: We are not ready to give up all of the fat fees that we generate by keeping the public in the dark about whose interests come first.

If you think that you are losing money because of high frequency trading, you ought to consider much money you could be saving by dealing with a financial professional who puts your needs first. As a note, CFPs are fiduciaries and here are the 10 Questions to Ask Financial Advisors.

575,0,"Earlier this week it was announced that the IRS will view Bitcoins and other forms of virtual payment as property and not currency. They will now have the same rules and taxes applied to them as stocks. Most importantly, this means that Bitcoin will now be subject to capital gains taxes. For heavy Bitcoin investors, this decision will be easier on their wallets, as the long term capital gains tax of 20 percent is significantly less than the 39.6 percent federal income tax.

However some people are worried that this new classification is detracting from the main goal of Bitcoin. As Bloomberg points out, if it is viewed as property, that could deter the volume of people who decide to use Bitcoin as currency.

There is also the matter of Bitcoin “mining,” a term used to describe the process of unlocking coins online. The IRS has stated that miners must now record the free market value of their mined coins as gross income on the date they receive it. This particular change came about as a disincentive for people to go looking for new coins.

On the flip side, there appear to not only be a lot of tax advantages to viewing this new currency as property, but a lot of value advantages as well. Bitcoin prices have fluctuated wildly over the years, and this new classification by the IRS may stabilize their value some. Along with this, companies or individuals who lose Bitcoins due to fraud or other reasons, like Mt. Gox in February, can now report that as capital loss on their taxes.

Protection is one of the big reasons that the government turned up the heat on categorizing virtual currencies. About three months before this ruling, NTA advocate Nina Olson argued that governments have to intervene and provide guidelines for consumers when new items enter the playing field. Along with this, regulators of Bitoin have been worried that the industry could be all too easily utilized for drug transactions or other illegal activities. So, as the New York Times states, “All that has put more pressure on governments around the world to figure out some way to regulate the industry.”

Who knows what the future may hold for virtual currency. For now, it looks like Bitcoin has taken its first steps into the streamlined system of exchange.","Earlier this week it was announced that the IRS will view Bitcoins and other forms of virtual payment as property and not currency.

5295,0,"WASHINGTON — More American mothers are staying at home with their children, a shift that reflects rising immigration and the fact many women are unable to find jobs after a sluggish period for the U.S. economy, a Pew analysis released Tuesday showed.

Twenty-nine percent of U.S. mothers, or about 10.4 million women, stayed at home in 2012. That is up from a low of 23 percent in 1999, and it marks a turnaround from three decades of decline.

The category of stay-at-home mothers with children under 18 includes women who are at home to care for their families and mothers who cannot find work, are disabled or in school, the Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data said.

Six percent of stay-at-home mothers, or about 634,000 people, said they were home with their children in 2012 because they could not find a job. That share is six times larger than it was in 2000.

The U.S. economy’s slow recovery from the recession of 2007-09 lead many Americans to give up looking for work, a trend that has changed over the past six months as people regain confidence in the job market.

The Pew analysis underscores women’s declining share of the U.S. workforce. Labor Department numbers show that 57.2 percent of women have a job or are looking for one, down just over 2 percentage points in a decade.

“With incomes stagnant in recent years for all but the college-educated, less educated workers in particular may weigh the cost of child care against wages and decide it makes more economic sense to stay home,” the Pew analysis said.

The rising share of stay-at-home mothers also could be caused by the increasing number of immigrants, who made up 13 percent of Americans in the 2010 U.S. census.

A third of stay-at-home mothers are immigrants, while immigrants make up only one in five working mothers.

Well over half of Asian and Hispanic women are immigrants, and stay-at-home Asian and Hispanic mothers are far more likely to have a working husband than whites or blacks, the analysis said.

About two in five mothers at home were younger than 35, compared with 35 percent of working mothers. Forty-nine percent have a high school diploma or less, compared with 30 percent of working mothers.

Fifty-one percent of mothers at home are white, compared with 60 percent of those who are working.

About two-thirds of stay-at-home mothers are married with working husbands, down from 85 percent in 1970 as U.S. marriage rates have fallen and the number of single mothers has risen, the analysis said.","Six percent of stay-at-home mothers, or about 634,000 people, said they were home with their children in 2012 because they could not find a job.

4623,0,"Lafarge, Holcim boards ok merger, confident on antitrust issues

The world’s top two cement makers are betting their merger plans aren’t going to run into an antitrust wall.

The boards of France’s Lafarge and Switzerland’s Holcim met separately over the weekend and approved plans for a merger that would create the world’s largest construction-materials company, with a combined market value of $US50 billion ($53 billion), a person familiar with the matter said.

Top Holcim executives are expected in Paris tonight AEDT, when the merger is likely to be announced.

The companies disclosed on Friday that they were in advanced talks but said a deal wasn’t certain. The swift progress toward completing a merger suggests the cement makers are confident they can overcome what are likely to be lofty antitrust hurdles.

Lafarge and Holcim are leading players in construction materials like cement, gravel, and asphalt, which is used to pave roads. Because the cement market is largely local — cement is cheap to make but expensive to transport — both companies have expanded in many of the same markets around the world.

The companies’ combined market share of cement-making capacity would approach 60 per cent in France, Canada and Morocco and 30 per cent in the US They would have annual sales of nearly $US43 billion, dwarfing rivals such as Germany’s HeidelbergCement, with $US18 billion in sales, and Mexico’s Cemex with $US15 billion.

A Cemex spokesman declined to comment. A Heidelberg representative couldn’t be reached for comment.

The sheer size of the two companies means the antitrust road is going to be challenging, especially in the US and Europe, said Ian Osburn, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in London.

Marco Slotboom, an antitrust lawyer at VVGB in Brussels, said the history of mergers in the cement-making sector will also mean greater scrutiny.

The European Commission is already probing Holcim’s acquisition of West German cement plants owned by Cemex, as well as the combination of Holcim and Cemex’s assets in Spain, which will leave Holcim with a 25 per cent stake. Brussels warned in October that the former deal might reduce competition in parts of Germany and Belgium, where the two companies compete.

The commission also has been investigating Holcim, Lafarge and six other companies for operating a suspected cartel in cement and cement-based products since December 2010.

Lafarge and Holcim have started discussing the need to sell assets in different parts of the world to get regulatory approval, said the person familiar with the matter. These could include selling cement plants and processing facilities for aggregates, which are used to make concrete.

The companies may have to sell up to 4 billion euros ($5.9 billion) worth of assets to overcome the concerns of antitrust authorities, Mr Osburn said. “There would be some quite serious antitrust issues requiring serious asset sales, but that may be a price that shareholders are willing to pay,” he said.

Holcim and Lafarge have battled overcapacity and sluggish growth in European construction, which hasn’t recovered from its debt crisis and the collapse of the Spanish housing market. The companies also face slower building activity in some developing countries, where Holcim and Lafarge have invested heavily.

Lafarge and Holcim on Friday cited “the strong complementarity of their portfolio and the cultural proximity between the two companies” as rationale for considering the merger.

Lafarge shareholders will be offered the opportunity to swap each share they hold for a Holcim share, in a deal that would value Lafarge at more than $US25 billion.

If the deal is completed, the new company would be based in Switzerland and led by Lafarge Chairman and Chief Executive Bruno Lafont, the person familiar with the matter said. The company would have operating headquarters in Paris and in Switzerland.

A deal would inject a burst of energy into Europe’s mergers and acquisitions market, where activity is still lagging other countries. There were $US199.2 billion worth of deals targeting European companies in the first quarter of 2014, up 11 per cent from the year earlier period, according to Dealogic. That compares with growth of 23 per cent globally, Dealogic found.

6983,0,"Colin Kaepernick is not a stupid guy. Not by any means. This space has been used to proclaim his skills and value on multiple occasions.

But situations like this “suspicious incident” he’s involved in feed into the very stereotype he’s trying to disprove. Even if the allegations are inaccurate, even if the media is just being its sensational self, the onus is still on Kaepernick.

He of all people should know better.

The 49ers star has been doubted, criticized, questioned, analyzed and judged to no end. He’s too tatted, too aloof, too into kissing his own biceps, too different from the traditional quarterback mold.

And now he wants a voluptuous contract, a stamp of approval as face of the franchise. He had to know such scrutiny would only intensify, which increases the importance of avoiding this type of nonsense.

Oh, and he’s a quarterback — sports’ version of POTUS, a position that requires likability as much as talent.

For the record, if Kaepernick is guilty of a crime, especially anything involving sexual assault, that’s a deal-breaker. But even presuming his innocence, he isn’t free from responsibility.

This would’ve been a great summer to spend with Steve Young, tucked away in some quiet corner of the world. Or take a pilgrimage into radio silence. He shouldn’t be caught within 10 miles of weed.

Because when you’re negotiating for the keys to the kingdom, the appearance of wrongdoing is nearly as damaging as actual bad acts.

No doubt, being young and rich and handsome comes with some perks. And Kaepernick, who has earned the pedestal on which he sits, has every right to enjoy the spoils. With that said, staying on the pedestal sometimes requires rejecting the spoils.

Kaepernick is a headstrong athlete. His sheer will is part of what makes him a formidable quarterback. That same mental fortitude can be used to avoid situations like this. He should be able dodge sketchy circumstances just as he does linebackers. At least for a time anyway.

Especially Kaepernick.

So far, Kaepernick has done nothing wrong.

He allegedly was hanging out with 49ers receiver Quinton Patton and Seattle receiver Ricardo Lockette. There was a woman there making drinks. There was marijuana being smoked.

The rest we don’t know. The woman says Kaepernick joined her in a room, helped undress her and she woke up at the hospital. TMZ is calling it a sexual assault investigation. Kaepernick says, “They make things up about me that never happened.”

The reality that Kaepernick and other polarizing athletes have to embrace: You can’t give them fodder to make up stuff about you. Three NFL players, a girl making drinks, at a hotel in Miami called Viceroy, and the girl ends up in the hospital — that’s easy. Nora Roberts could get two novels out of that scenario.

When you’re on the cusp of something big, as Kaepernick is, extreme measures may be necessary. No, he shouldn’t have to hide in a cave. But he should be willing to if that’s what it takes. It’s the choice leaders make sometimes.

In the end, none of the pleasures he had were worth the scrutiny he’s under now. Not worth having your name and “sexual assault” mentioned in articles across the land for days. Not worth having millions of NFL fans speculating to fill in the information gaps.

And it’s certainly not worth it if the 49ers come back and say, “We were thinking of giving you $20 million a year, but now … “

Kaepernick should’ve had the foresight to see this coming. He should be reading every situation he’s in for what could happen that might jeopardize his empire. He should be able to, for the big picture, make the sacrifices necessary to avoid police blotters and TMZ.

So what that it might mean losing out on some fun? Or being boring. That’s the smart play for someone people are just waiting to see screw up.

He of all people should know better.

460,0,"Fixed mortgage rates moved higher last week, according to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac.

The increase was anticipated after the Federal Reserve seemed to signal last week that it could begin raising interest rates sooner than expected.

The 30-year fixed-rate average climbed to 4.4 percent with an average 0.6 point. It was 4.32 percent a week ago and 3.57 percent a year ago.

The 15-year fixed-rate average jumped to 3.42 percent with an average 0.6 point. It was 3.32 percent a week ago and 2.76 percent a year ago.

Hybrid adjustable rate mortgages were mixed. The five-year ARM average rose to 3.1 percent with an average 0.5 point. It was 3.02 percent a week ago and 2.68 percent a year ago.

The one-year ARM average dropped to 2.44 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 2.49 percent a week ago.

“Mortgage rates rose following the uptick on the 10-year Treasury note after comments by the Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen indicated a possible increase in interest rates as soon as early 2015,” Frank E. Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist, said in a statement. “Also, the [Standard & Poor’s]/Case-Shiller 20-city composite house price index rose 13.2 percent over the 12-months ending in January 2014.”

Meanwhile, mortgage applications declined last week, according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. The Market Composite Index, a measure of total loan application volume, dropped 3.5 percent. The Refinance index fell 8 percent, while the Purchase Index rose 3 percent.

The refinance share of mortgage activity declined for the seventh week in a row, accounting for 54 percent of all applications, its lowest level since April 2010.","Fixed mortgage rates moved higher last week, according to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac.

2386,0,"Taco Bell has started a breakfast war.

If there was any question as to what company the Yum Brands' (NYSE:YUM) chain has targeted, those questions were answered when Taco Bell began running ads in support of its new breakfast offerings. The commercials feature numerous men, all of whom happened to be named ""Ronald McDonald,"" extolling the virtues of the Mexican chain's morning menu.

McDoanld's (NYSE:MCD) has a 25% market share of the $50 billion fast food breakfast market, according to market researcher Technomic. The company plans to aggressively defend its turf against Taco Bell. McDonald's is offering a free cup of coffee for two weeks starting on March 31, and the chain has made noise about increasing the hours it serves breakfast.

""We know that breakfast on the weekend cut off at 10:30 doesn't go very well,"" Jeff Stratton, the chain's U.S. head told CNN Money. He said the company is ""just beginning"" to reconsider how to best serve up the meal.

McDonald's generally stop serving breakfast at 10:30 a.m., while the new Taco Bell breakfast is being offered until 11 a.m.

Taco Bell's breakfast menu

Dunkin Donuts NASDAQ:DNKN) Instead of just offering a breakfast burrito, Taco Bell's breakfast menu includes an array of creative choices. There is, of course, a breakfast burrito and a breakfast taco, but the company is also offering the A.M. Crunchwrap, which is a tortilla stuffed with eggs, cheese, meat, some sort of vaguely cheese-like sauce, and a hash brown. Breakfast customers can also pick the Waffle Taco, which is a waffle wrapped around your choice of meat and eggs with the same cheese sauce, or Cinnabon Delights, which look likeMunchkins (but which are stuffed with Cinnabon icing).

The drink choices are unconventional as well. Though coffee appears on some of the signs and orange juice is available, Sierra Mist and other soft drinks appear alongside the breakfast items on some of the chain's signage.

How is Taco Bell breakfast doing?

In a less-than-scientific study, I spent Sunday morning from about 8:45 a.m. until 9:45 a.m. embedded in a Taco Bell with my 10-year-old son. We visited one of the chain's locations on a busy turnpike in Central Connecticut within sight of a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), less than a mile from a thriving McDonald's, and with at least three Dunkin' Donuts stores within a two-mile radius.



We drove by the other chains on our way to Taco Bell and on our way out. McDonald's had a full parking lot and its dual drive-through windows were busy. The Dunkin' Donuts closest to Taco Bell had a backed-up drive-through and a full (albeit very small) parking lot. Starbucks, which we could monitor from our Taco Bell window, did a steady drive-up business and appeared moderately but not excessively busy.

The Taco Bell was essentially empty, however, and saw fewer than 10 customers during the hour we were there. The chain had signs outside touting breakfast (as well as significant window signage) but customers -- at least during this hour on the first weekend of the Taco Bell breakfast -- were not coming.

The Taco Bell breakfast experience

If my hour-long visit is indicative of the Taco Bell breakfast experience in general, the chain has some glitches to work out. The staff in my particular store was eager and friendly, but seemed poorly trained on the new menu. They could describe the products, but were unsure how the various combination deals worked -- especially when a few of the scant group of customers we saw wanted to make substitutions.

Our order -- which consisted of a sausage A.M. Crunchwrap and a four-piece Cinnabon Delights -- somehow resulted in us getting (and paying for) two orders of six of the mini treats. (This may have been my ordering mistake, but I specified wanting four pieces.) My son was delighted, as he was quite enamored with the little pastries.

The Crunchwrap was less pleasant, as the sausage and hash brown were skimpy -- seemingly thinner than what McDonald's serves -- and the cheese sauce was unpleasant and not even vaguely reminiscent of cheese.

It also took about 10 minutes to get our food, which seemed odd given that there were no other customers and the Cinnabon treats at most had to be warmed up -- they certainly are not baked fresh.



Can Taco Bell become a breakfast player?

Taco Bell is attempting to offer a morning alternative to McDonald's and the other fast food purveyors. The products are interesting -- different but recognizable. The quality may not be great, but this is a company that has had great success without making high-quality ingredients part of its pitch to customers.

If Taco Bell is going to become a breakfast player -- assuming that the store I went to is typical -- the staff needs better training. In general, the pace of filling orders needs to be much faster and the employees must know what they are selling and how the various combination deals work.

Taco Bell should also consider amping up its morning beverage selection. This is a chain that markets itself to the energy drink generation, but there was no sign of the Mountain Dew and orange juice beverage the company tested in 2012. The store wasn't even selling Mountain Dew A.M., which is available nationwide, or any other morning-appropriate energy drink (though a full array of soda was offered, including Mountain Dew). The only coffee choice was basic coffee, which places it behind not only Starbucks but McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts.

If Taco Bell wants customers to run for the breakfast border instead of heading to the Golden Arches it needs to do better, improve service, and tweak its product line.","McDonald's generally stop serving breakfast at 10:30 a.m., while the new Taco Bell breakfast is being offered until 11 a.m.Taco Bell's breakfast menuDunkin Donuts NASDAQ:DNKN) Instead of just offering a breakfast burrito, Taco Bell's breakfast menu includes an array of creative choices.

6198,0,"Carl Icahn’s battle with eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) has ended in a negotiated settlement that includes a confidentiality agreement muzzling the activist investor’s blusterous attacks against the e-commerce company.

Icahn agrees to confidentiality agreement muzzling his vocal attacks

Icahn had fought for eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) to spin off PayPal and proposed two of his handpicked independent directors, who had been identified as somewhat hostile to the eBay board. Icahn and eBay agreed to end Icahn’s proxy battle which was set to come to a head this May with a vote of shareholders. Icahn and eBay agreed to a confidentiality agreement and eBay said they would appoint former AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) CEO, non-executive chairman of Motorola and current chairman of CVS Caremark Corporation (NYSE:CVS) as an independent director.

“Clear win”

“It was a clear win,” eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) CEO John Donahoe let slip in an interview with Bloomberg’s Erik Schatzker, a sheepish smile on his face. When addressing the confidentiality agreement he offered Icahn, Donahoe said, “It’s something we would offer to any large shareholder and is rather straightforward,” noting that the agreement would make Icahn “longer term in his orientation.” On CNBC Donahoe had indicated he anticipated that Icahn would remain in the stock as the long term, a view that is not universally accepted.

Personal tone

Icahn’s battle with eBay had taken a personal tone from the start. Rather than focus on the specifics of his proposal, Icahn had made blusterous statements impugning on the reputations of eBay board members, particularly Marc Andreessen, and his involvement in a business deal where he bought Skype from eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and later sold it to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) for a handsome profit – an issue entirely unrelated to eBay’s potential spinoff of PayPal.

When Schatzker asked if Icahn had used bullying tactics with eBay, Donahoe said in their behind the scenes conversations Icahn was respectful. In his public comments, Icahn had also attacked the reputation of Donahoe. In one press release, Icahn had said “if eBay were a private company, Donahoe would be fired…” When speaking about eBay’s sale of Skype to Andreessen Icahn said “…Donahoe is either incompetent or negligent or, perhaps even worse, was simply taking the easy path of bowing to the wishes of a respected and powerful board member.”

Is new board member member of corporate “boys club?”

Icahn had also said that Donahoe was a corporate member of the “boys club.” What Icahn got in independent director Dorman was a corporate insider unlikely to rock the board in the fashion Icahn had proposed — a corporate conformist, it would seem.

Speculation before the announcement was that Icahn was on track to lose his proxy vote scheduled for mid-May, with indications that eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) had received private survey results showing Icahn was headed for a major loss. “Why give Icahn anything?” Shatzker asked of Donahoe as he started his interview. Perhaps the truth is Icahn wasn’t given anything in the deal except a method to save face.","Carl Icahn’s battle with eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) has ended in a negotiated settlement that includes a confidentiality agreement muzzling the activist investor’s blusterous attacks against the e-commerce company.

“I’m shocked, shocked to find gambling is going on in here.” Captain Renault (Casablanca)

“High frequency traders (HFT) have found ways to use their speed to gain an advantage that few understand.” Michael Lewis (60 Minutes)

Many years ago they called it having an edge, knowing a little more than the next guy. In the 20’s it was simply letting a few select insiders have the information about an action before the action was taken. After the crash of ‘29 rules were implemented to discourage the practice of trading on inside information. Such notables as Michael Milkin and Martha Stewart, who felt these rules did not apply to them, paid the price and a little jail time for enhancing their net worth with advance warnings.

Now however having inside information is a thing of the past, unless your name is Stevie Cohen and your firm is SAC. You simply buy the biggest, strongest, fastest and most strategically placed servers and computers. You then insert a series of algorithms so you are able to trade ahead of everyone else.

To be able to trade ahead of most of John Q. Public has never been a big deal. After a long day at the office the average trader/investor would come home and study a few charts then make his picks, to be bought or sold on the opening the next day. A losing game for John Q., an easy win for the HFT, and no real need for inside information since nothing was a market mover.

Where it gets interesting is when the large institutions place substantial trades that in fact do move markets. The algorithm and computer are able to read the trade and place either corresponding or inverse trades BEFORE the institutional or retail trade is executed.

As an example, if the algorithm sees a 25,000 share block to be purchased it will accumulate 100 and 200 share lots to reach the 25,000 number, without creating an awareness in the marketplace. The algorithm will then sell the accumulated shares to the buyer for a higher price than the accumulated price. All of this is done in a fraction of a second. In many instances the buyer is a customer of the seller. Nothing like loyalty.

High frequency traders will say it is not insider trading it is simply an advancement in technology. Others will say it is just the market and caveat emptor. Regardless, the old inside trading has become algorithmic frontrunning with a quick twist.

Contrary to Mr. Lewis’s opinion, it is not difficult to understand that once again the boys with the biggest baddest and fastest get the spoils. It makes no difference whether its 1929 or 2014 or it’s a ticker tape or an algorithm, inside trading is inside trading over a matter of months or in less than a nanosecond.","After the crash of ‘29 rules were implemented to discourage the practice of trading on inside information.

1488,0,"Stock was surging for CBS Outdoor on Friday on its debut on the NYSE. Shares of the advertising company a subsidiary of CBS were up by $2.02 or over 7.2% in trading in the morning to $30.02 after they peaked earlier Friday morning at $30.47.

The initial public offering for CBS Outdoor Americas included 20 million shares that were priced per share at $28, which was the high end of a range that was expected to be between $26 and $28 a share.

The company based in New York raised in its IPO over $560 million. At the price of the IPO, the market value for CBS Outdoors would be $3.36 billion. There would be approximately 120 million outstanding shares following the offering.

The company is giving underwriters an option of 30-days to buy another 3 million shares if there is a strong demand.

CBS Outdoors announced in one of its regulatory filings that it had about 330,000 available displays for U.S. advertising with just under 26,200 displays throughout Latin American and Canada as of the end of 2013. Customers for CBS Outdoors included McDonald’s Corp and Apple, Inc.

The company is attempting to maintain pace with today’s changes by converting the traditional billboards to digital ones. As of the end of 2013, the company had 373 digital billboards across the U.S.

CBS Outdoor in the regulatory filing said digital billboards now produce as much as four times more revenue for each display than do traditional billboards.

The company has ramped up efforts to convert additional traditional billboards over to digital as the costs of conversion decline.

Once the IPO is complete, CBS will have over 80% ownership of CBS Outdoor. CBS is planning to divest shares of the outdoor advertising company by doing a split-off later in 2014.

Once that takes place, CBS Outdoor is planning to convert and become a real estate investment trust. The REIT plans were announced by CBS in January of 2013.

Icahn and eBay had been in an acrimonious tussle over PayPal, the e-commerce company's quickly growing mobile payment arm. Icahn, who owns about 2 percent of eBay's shares, said repeatedly the company should spin off all or part of PayPal, while eBay has said the company is better as a whole. He has also criticized the company's directors including CEO John Donahoe.

But under a deal announced Thursday, Icahn said he is dropping the PayPal strategy and withdrawing his proposal to put two nominees on the board.

In return, eBay will make David Dorman an independent director, the 10th on the 12-member board. The 60-year-old Dorman is chairman of CVS Caremark Corp. and founding partner of Centerview Capital Technology.

Icahn said he still believes eBay should spin off PayPal and said in a statement that he'll seek confidential talks with the company, whose leadership Icahn has labeled as ""either incompetent or negligent.""

Icahn said he and Donahoe have agreed to meet regularly when Donahoe is in New York to talk about eBay's strategic options.

Donahoe, in an interview with CNBC early Thursday, brushed off the harsh criticism from Icahn that had been directly leveled at him.

""I haven't been paying a lot of attention to the back and forth,"" he told the business network.

Icahn signed a confidentiality agreement that covers any nonpublic information that board members and certain company executives may share with him. And eBay will not put into place a policy that would prevent those individuals from speaking with Icahn.

Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jordan E. Rohan said he thought Icahn's pressure had actually been good for the company.

""We have been of the view that the activist interest in a PayPal spin has provided support for shares of eBay,"" he said. ""With the removal of Carl Icahn's activist agitation and lack of a near-term catalyst of a spin, we believe shares will be pressured as weaker fundamentals return to focus.""

969,0,"Australia said late on Friday that a New Zealand air force plane had spotted objects in the new search area. Reuters

An air and sea search for a missing Malaysian passenger jet moved 1,100 km (685 miles) north on Friday, after Australian authorities coordinating the operation in the remote Indian Ocean received new information from Malaysia that suggested the plane ran out of fuel earlier than thought.

The dramatic shift in the search area, moving it further than the distance between London and Berlin, followed analysis of radar and satellite data that showed the missing plane had travelled faster than had been previously calculated, and so would have burned through its fuel load quicker.

Australia said late on Friday that a New Zealand air force plane had spotted objects in the new search area. The sightings would need to be confirmed by ship, which was not expected until Saturday, the Australian Maritime and Safety Authority (AMSA) said.

""We're still waiting on imagery ourselves,"" said an AMSA spokesman.

The latest twist underscores the perplexing and frustrating hunt for evidence in the near three-week search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which vanished from civilian radar screens less than an hour into a Kuala Lumpur to Beijing flight.

Malaysia says the plane was likely diverted deliberately but investigators have turned up no apparent motive or other red flags among the 227 passengers or the 12 crew.

Malaysian officials said the new search area was the result of a painstaking analysis of Malaysian military radar data and satellite readings from British company Inmarsat carried out by U.S., Chinese, British and Malaysian investigators.

Engine performance analysis by the plane's manufacturer Boeing helped investigators determine how long the plane could have flown before it ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean, they said.

""Information which had already been examined by the investigation was re-examined in light of new evidence drawn from the Inmarsat data analysis,"" Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference.

AIRCRAFT RE-DIRECTED

For more than a week, ships and surveillance planes have been scouring seas 2,500 km (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth, where satellite images had shown possible debris from Flight MH370, which went missing on March 8.

Ten aircraft searching on Friday were immediately re-directed to the new area of 319,000 sq km (123,000 sq miles), roughly the size of Poland, around 1,850 km (1,150 miles) west of Perth. The Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation was also redirecting satellites there, AMSA said.

A flotilla of Australian and Chinese ships would take longer to shift north, however, with the Australian naval ship the HMAS Success not due to arrive until Saturday morning.

The new search area is larger, but closer to Perth, allowing aircraft to spend longer on site by shortening travel times. It is also vastly more favourable in terms of the weather as it is out of the deep sea region known as the Roaring 40s for its huge seas and frequent storm-force winds.

""I'm not sure that we'll get perfect weather out there, but it's likely to be better more often than what we've seen in the past,"" John Young, general manager of the emergency response division of Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), told reporters, adding the previous search site was being abandoned.

""We have moved on from those search areas to the newest credible lead,"" he said.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said earlier that the shift was based on analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca. At that time, the Boeing 777 was making a radical diversion west from its course.

Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, said at Friday's news conference he was ""not at liberty"" to give the exact path of the aircraft. Officials close to the investigation told Reuters last week that the plane may have passed close to Port Blair, the capital of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 550 miles (885 km) further northwest from where Malaysia has said its military radar last detected it.

SATELLITE IMAGES

The shift comes less than a day after the latest reports of sightings of possible wreckage, captured by Thai and Japanese satellites in roughly the same frigid expanse of sea as earlier images reported by France, Australia and China.

Images had shown suspected debris, including pieces as large as 24 metres (70 ft), within the original search area in the southern Indian Ocean.

Potential debris has also been seen from search aircraft, but none has been picked up or confirmed as the wreckage of Flight MH370.

Hishammuddin said it was still possible that those objects were debris from the plane, as any wreckage could have been swept hundreds of miles from the crash site by now.

""Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week,"" he said.

The U.S. Navy said on Friday it was sending a second P8-Poseidon, its most advanced maritime surveillance aircraft, to help in the search.

""It's critical to continue searching for debris so we can reverse-forecast the wind, current and sea state since March 8 to recreate the position where MH370 possibly went into the water,"" said Commander Tom Moneymaker, a U.S. 7th Fleet oceanographer.

The United States has also sent a device that can be towed behind a ship to pick up faint pings from the plane's black box voice and data recorders, but time is running out.

""We've got to get this initial position right prior to deploying the Towed Pinger Locator since the MH370's black box has a limited battery life and we can't afford to lose time searching in the wrong area,"" Moneymaker said.","Australia said late on Friday that a New Zealand air force plane had spotted objects in the new search area.

5258,0,"The number of Americans without health insurance declined slightly in the first three months of the year, reaching the lowest point of President Barack Obama's administration, a Gallup poll released Monday suggests.

The survey of 43,500 adults, conducted between Jan. 2 to March 31, indicates that the uninsured rate fell during the first quarter of 2014 from 17.1 percent to 15.6 percent. The rate has been falling since the third quarter for 2013, when it hit a record high of 18 percent.

Gallup called it a “sign that a sign that the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as ‘Obamacare,’ appears to be accomplishing its goal of increasing the percentage of Americans with health insurance coverage. Even within this year’s first quarter, the uninsured rate fell consistently, from 16.2 percent in January to 15.6 percent in February to 15.0 percent in March. And within March, the rate dropped more than a point, from 15.8 percent in the first half of the month to 14.7 percent in the second half – indicating that enrollment through the health care exchanges increased as the March 31 deadline approached.”

The law mandated that most Americans obtain health insurance by the end of last month or risk a financial penalty, although the Obama administration created a grace period and is giving people until April 15 to complete an application. The law also provides for subsidies to help people earning up to 400 percent of the poverty line buy insurance.

The law also provides money to expand the Medicaid program for low-income Americans, but Alabama and about half of the states have declined offer.

While the poll did not record a giant drop in the uninsured rate, it shows a broad reduction. All races, income groups and age groups posted gains, with blacks and households earning less than $36,000 a year benefiting the most. The uninsured rate dropped by 3.3 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, among those categories.

Obama announced last week that 7.1 million people had enrolled in insurance through government-run exchanges, although The Washington Post later challenged his math, placing the true figure between 5.5 million and 6 million people. And some of questioned just how many uninsured people are buying policies on the exchanges, with indications that many of them are folks who previously had insurance.

Gallup noted that it is impossible to say, also, how many new Medicaid recipients previously had insurance.

But the survey suggests that the county has experienced and overall net drop in the number of uninsured and that the rate continues to drop.

“Regardless, the decline in the percentage of uninsured over the course of the first quarter almost certainly includes the effects of expanded Medicaid eligibility policies,” Gallup wrote. “It is also likely, in turn, that not all new enrollees will ultimately pay their insurance premiums, which would result in a subsequent change in status from insured to uninsured at some point later in 2014.”

Gallup said it would continue to monitor the uninsured rate.","The number of Americans without health insurance declined slightly in the first three months of the year, reaching the lowest point of President Barack Obama's administration, a Gallup poll released Monday suggests.

5586,0,"Dollar broadly lower vs. counterparts ahead of Fed

Investing.com - The dollar remained lower against the other major currencies on Tuesday, as the yen gained ground after the Bank of Japan indicated that further stimulus is unlikely in the short term, while markets eyed Wednesday’s Federal Reserve minutes.

The dollar was lower against the yen, with sliding 0.87% to 102.17.

The yen strengthened after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda indicated that the bank was unlikely to implement further stimulus measures at present. He added that growth and inflation were likely to continue to pick up in the coming months despite a sales tax increase in April.

Earlier Tuesday, the BoJ voted to keep its key policy target of increasing base money unchanged at an annual pace of ¥60 trillion to ¥70 trillion after ending its two-day policy meeting.

The dollar remained under pressure ahead of the minutes of the Fed’s March meeting.

Last week’s U.S. payrolls report came in slightly below expectations, while Fed Chair Janet Yellen said recently that slack in labor markets showed accommodative policies will still be needed for some time.

The euro was higher against the dollarl with up 0.35% to 1.3790. Demand for the euro was underpinned after comments by European Central Bank officials on Monday tempered expectations for quantitative easing.

Last week the ECB left the door open to further stimulus measures, saying that unconventional monetary policy instruments may be necessary to avert the risk of ongoing low inflation in the euro zone.

On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund said the ECB should consider all unconventional measures, including quantitative easing, and should implement them as soon as they are ready.

In its quarterly World Economic Outlook report, the IMF said it expects the global economy to grow by 3.6% this year, and 3.9% in 2015, both 0.1 percentage point lower than in January.

The fund said it expects the euro zone economy to expand by 1.2% this year and 1.5% in 2015, both 0.1 percentage point higher than in its January forecast.

The pound was higher against the dollar, with gaining 0.82% to 1.6744 after the IMF upgraded its growth forecast for the U.K. economy to 2.9% in 2014, from a previous forecast of 2.5%.

Earlier Tuesday, data showed that U.K. industrial output increased at the fastest pace since June 2013 in February, boosting the outlook for the broader recovery and fuelling speculation that the Bank of England could raise interest rates sooner.

Meanwhile, the dollar slid lower against the Swiss franc, with down 0.37% to 0.8846.

The Australian dollar rose to four-and-half month highs, with up 0.72% to 0.9337, while climbed 0.60% to 0.8651 and dropped 0.37% to 1.0932.

The Canadian dollar shrugged off weaker-than-forecast data on building permits for February and a separate report showing that domestic housing starts fell in March.

300,0,"Microsoft has, after years of speculation, released some of its Office applications for Apple iPad owners – but you'll need an Office 365 subscription to use them in anything other than a lobotomized form.

Nadella holds his first press conference since taking former CEO Steve Ballmer's crown

The Apple App Store now has Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint available for download for iOS 7, and the apps have been reworked to fit in with the iPad's layout and form factor. The apps will allow people to view Office files on their Cupertino fondleslab, but not create new documents or edit existing ones – for that you'll need an Office 365 cloud subscription, starting at $70 a year.

""When it comes to Office 365, the vision is fairly straightforward,"" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at a press conference in San Francisco today. ""It is to make sure that the one billion Office users have access to the high fidelity Office experience on every device they love to use. Today's announcement marks one more step in that direction.""

It's easy to see why Microsoft is so keen to tie Office 365 into the new apps – Office is Microsoft's cash cow and generates more than half its profits, so Redmond won't be willing to give all that up any time soon.

The apps themselves look very polished for a version one product, adding credence to the rumors that this has been developed and then held over for some time. There are also iPad-specific features, such as the ability to simulate a laser pointer on a PowerPoint demonstration using your finger.

It's worth noting that this new touchscreen-optimized version is available right now for the Apple iPad, whereas Microsoft's own Windows 8-powered Surface slabs are still using traditional mouse-and-keyboard-centric desktop Office software. You'd be forgiven for thinking the Surface would come first.

Collaborative working is possible on the paid-for apps and the Microsoft demo team showed five people working on a document concurrently, with change tracking enabled to see who has been editing what and when.

Nadella said the goal was to make Office available on any device at any time – well, almost. There are now tools to access Office documents on iPhones and iPads, Android gadgets and Windows 8 kit, but when El Reg asked if Redmond will bother developing for BlackBerry, the answer was a very firm ""no,"" from one of the Office team.

While there are bound to be plenty of individuals who want the ability to handle Office files on their iPad, the main thrust of Nadella's announcement was aimed at attracting enterprises. Microsoft also showed off new tools, dubbed the Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS), for IT managers managing the new software; the EMS will be out in May.

EMS uses Azure Active Directory Premium, Windows Intune, and Azure Rights Management Services to control devices and the applications that come on them. Active Directory give IT managers a pool of over 1,000 applications that can be cleared for use by staff with a single sign-on, or two-factor if preferred.

InTune will give IT managers better control over mobiles and PCs, including remote wipe and, on the mobile side, better support for Android devices and Samsung's KNOX platform. Azure Rights Management is integrated to lock down data as needed.

Nadella said that over the next four weeks Microsoft will be fleshing out its ""Mobile First – Cloud First"" strategy, first at the Build developers conference next week and at subsequent events covering data management. Presumably the company's Surface RT slab, the ARM-powered rival to the iPad, will feature in there somewhere. Right? ®

6565,0,"Source: thinkstock April 10, 2014: Markets opened lower on Thursday and could do nothing to turn the tide. Healthcare stocks led the drop, with financials close behind. Two major financial stocks report earnings Friday morning before the bell: JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC). Should be an interesting start to the trading day. At the close of trading today the DJIA was down 1.41%, the S&P 500 was down 1.96%, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.96%.

There were only two DJIA stocks that went against the grain today and posted gains, led by McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) which traded at $99.60 posted a gain of 1.27% today. The stock’s 52-week range of $92.22 to $103.70. Share volume was about 15% higher than the daily average of around 5.4 million shares traded. There was no particular news on the company although it’s generally acknowledged that the free coffee promotion has succeeded in stealing some thunder from Taco Bell’s new breakfast menu.

Telecom behemoth AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) traded up 0.83% at $35.21 in a 52-week range of $31.74 to $39.00. This has got to be the company’s dividend keeping investors happy on a day when there was little cheer to go around. Volume was about equal to the daily average of around 31 million shares traded.

The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) slipped in the final minutes to close down 0.26% at $38.89 in a 52-week range of $36.83 to $43.43. Volume was about equal to the daily average of around 17 million shares traded. Another solid, blue chipper sporting a good dividend yield of 3.2%.

6221,0,"In this April 10, 2014 photo Laura Hankins sits with the paperwork in West Milwaukee that she needed to go through to help her 19-year-old daughter with her federal returns after finding out that someone using her name had already filed for a refund. It took Laura about 20 hours to fill out forms, gather information and photocopy documents because her daughter, Claire Hankins, couldnÂ?t file electronically after the tax identity theft was discovered. (Photo: AP Photo/Carrie Antlfinger)

Laura Hankins knew something was wrong when she filed her daughter's tax return and it was rejected hours later: An identity thief already had sent in a return using the 19-year-old's personal information.

""This is the first time in her life she has ever filed income taxes, after earning all of $1,800 stocking products on grocery store shelves,"" Hankins said. ""I did her taxes for her online, but immediately she got the rejection.""

Thieves have claimed billions of dollars in bogus tax refunds from the IRS by swiping the Social Security numbers and identities of schoolchildren in Florida, prisoners in Pennsylvania, teachers in Washington state and soldiers deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Hackers and employees with access to thousands of names stored in company databases have tapped into reams of personal information, allowing them to submit hundreds of fraudulent returns by computer and receive refunds within days. Five people in Cincinnati were sentenced to prison late last year for using the names of employees at nursing homes and hospitals to file tax returns.

It all adds up to a lot of frustration for legitimate taxpayers who face more paperwork and months of waiting for their tax refunds.

Hankins was told her daughter Claire, a college student from West Milwaukee, Wis., would get her refund in about six months. But Hankins first had to spend about 20 hours filling out forms, gathering information and photocopying documents because she couldn't file electronically after the tax identity theft was discovered in February.

""Some kids get to go to Florida for spring break, but she got to go to the West Milwaukee police station to file a theft report,"" said Hankins, who added that her daughter is worried about what will happen next now that her personal information is out there.

The IRS paid out nearly $4 billion to people using stolen identities in 2012, according to a government report. Since identity theft fraud exploded over the past three years, the agency has made stopping it a priority, but thieves are becoming more aggressive and still finding ways to get around increased scrutiny.

""It's like that game of Whac-A-Mole. When you're attacking one scheme, they come up with another,"" said Wifredo Ferrer, the U.S. attorney in South Florida, a hot spot for the schemes.

Fraudulent filers have evaded detection lately by getting refunds loaded onto prepaid debit cards instead of receiving them by check. Others have robbed postal workers to get refunds and even recruited mail carriers to take part, Ferrer said.

A former records clerk in Alabama's prisons department was charged in January with selling inmates' personal information to claim over $1 million in refunds. Three others were sentenced to prison for taking part, including a mail carrier who stole the refunds from the mail.

""They're getting very creative by using people in the inside,"" Ferrer said. ""They're creative and brazen. They're using the IRS like their own ATM.""

The IRS said Thursday that it has started more than 200 investigations into identity theft and refund fraud schemes this filing season and that enforcement efforts are taking place nationwide. It said investigators are especially focused on the misuse of specialized identification numbers assigned to firms that electronically file tax returns.

But the ease of the schemes means no one is immune. The best steps to reduce the chance of refund fraud are to protect Social Security numbers and other personal information.

The practice has spread to the most unlikely of places. Even employees and volunteers within the Archdiocese of Seattle became victims last month in a case that's still being investigated.

Because the goal of the IRS is to get refunds out quickly, it often sends them out before verifying wages and other income from employers and financial institutions. Victims don't know they've been targeted until they file their taxes.

Dallas radio host Ed Wallace said he found out just over a year ago that someone filed a return using his name. What surprised him was that it got through even though his name was misspelled, his address had been changed and his wife's name wasn't on the form.

""I can't believe there wasn't a field in the IRS computers to alert them,"" Wallace said. ""They must have so many they can't keep up.""

He spent about $2,700 on attorney fees to straighten out the mess.

Among the biggest frustrations is the amount of time it takes victims to resolve the issue with the IRS and get their refunds.

The average wait for identity theft victims to clear their cases had been about 10 months but is now down to three months, according to the IRS.

Agency Commissioner John Koskinen said the IRS has more than doubled the employees dedicated to working on identity theft and improved its screening to catch suspicious returns.

The IRS stopped more than $12 billion in fraudulent refunds from going to identity thieves in 2012, compared with $8 billion the year before, according to an inspector general's report released in November.

6859,0,"COLUMBUS -- The state will now require companies drilling horizontally for oil and gas in areas near known underground faults or that have experienced earthquakes to install seismic monitors to track future earth movement.

And in cases where magnitudes of such events reach certain levels, the state would require fracking activities to stop while the cause is investigated.

The permit changes were announced Friday by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources in response to a series of earthquakes in the Youngstown area, which state officials say likely were connected to hydraulic fracturing.

""While we can never be 100 percent sure that drilling activities are connected to a seismic event, caution dictates that we take these new steps to protect human health, safety and the environment,"" ODNR Director James Zehringer said in a released statement. ""Not only will this reasonable course of action help to ensure public health and safety, but it will also help us to expand our underground maps and provide more information about all types of seismicity in Ohio.""

New permits for horizontal drilling within 3 miles of known faults or in the vicinity of seismic events greater than a 2.0 magnitude will require drillers to install ""sensitive"" seismic monitors.

If the latter detect movement of a magnitude of more than 1.0, drilling and related activities would have to stop while the quakes are investigated. And drilling would be suspended if fracturing is determined to be the cause.

Last month, the U.S. Geological Survey recorded five earthquakes in an area south of Lowellville in Mahoning County, ranging in magnitude from 2.1 to 3. The Vindicator earlier reported that Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory registered additional seismic activity in the area.

ODNR subsequently ordered a company to cease its drilling activities in the vicinity of the epicenter.

The agency said Friday that its ""geologists believe the sand and water injected into the well during the hydraulic fracturing process may have increased pressure on unknown micro faults in the area.""

Bethany McCorkle, an ODNR spokeswoman, said further hydraulic fracturing at the site has been suspended, but the company will be allowed to produce oil and gas from other wells already in place there.

More than 800 wells have been drilled in eastern Ohio's emerging shale oil fields, according to ODNR.

The state already requires seismic monitors on injection wells. McCorkle said she was aware of no other states other than Ohio that require seismic monitors at horizontal drill sites near underground faults or areas that have experienced earthquakes.

""We're being cautious,"" she said. ""It's very proactive, but we think it's necessary.""

In a released statement, Tom Stewart, executive vice president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, urged caution in responding to the Youngstown-area quakes, calling the Poland Township seismic activity ""a rare and isolated event that should not cast doubt about the safety of hydraulic fracturing""

He added, ""Ohio has benefited greatly from a robust oil and gas industry, and this should not curtail development. Understanding the geology of an area thousands of feet below ground is complicated. While advanced technology has greatly increased our knowledge of potential seismicity and fault lines, it is not always a precise science.

""We will thoroughly review the recommendations provided by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, but will only support measures based on sound, scientific principles and practicality.""

9954,1,"Lindsay Lohan is kissing and telling, but not the way you would think.

The actress, whose new OWN docuseries, Lindsay, premiered in the US this week, reportedly made a list of all the people she's hooked up with over the years.

The 36-name list includes some pretty famous Hollywood stars like Zac Efron, Justin Timberlake, Adam Levine, and the late Heath Ledger.

In Touch exclusively obtained the list, which was allegedly made recently while Lindsay was hanging out with a group of girlfriends at The Beverly Hills Hotel back in January.

While we don't know exactly when any of the hookups took place, it's safe to say that a few of the guys on the list might be squirming a bit today - especially married men like Justin Timberlake and Jamie Dornan as well as Adam Levine and Evan Peters, who both have fiancées.

Justin Bieber most overexposed celeb



Troubled pop star Justin Bieber has been named the most overexposed celebrity of 2014 in a new poll by Forbes Magazine.



The Baby hitmaker tops the list of more than 6,600 celebrities, which has been put together by the publication’s editors using public opinion polling.



Bieber was cited as overexposed by 67 per cent of the respondents, due in part to his recent legal troubles, including his arrest in January for driving under the influence.



Bieber’s inclusion on this year’s list is considered unusual, as it is usually dominated by US reality TV stars such as Kim Kardashian, who came in second with a 61 per cent rating.



Her sisters Kourtney and Khloe rank ninth and 10th, while their mother and manager Kris Jenner tied for sixth place with former Jersey Shore star Nicole ’Snooki’ Polizzi at 55 per cent.Coming in third is actress Lindsay Lohan on 59 per cent.



Controversial singer Miley Cyrus is fourth with 57 per cent, and child TV star Alana ’Honey Boo Boo’ Thompson rounds out the top five at 56 per cent.

Tattoos ridiculous, says Kelly Osbourne



Kelly Osbourne says that tattoos are a form of justifying the ‘‘ridiculous things we do in life’’.



The TV star, who is currently shooting Sharknado 2, shared her thoughts with fans as she underwent her third laser tattoo removal surgery.



The star has various inkings over her body, including a heart lock with the word Daddy above it on her arm and skull and crossbones on both of her feet.



‘‘As humans we fill our conscience with cliches to selfishly justify the ridiculous things we do in life such as getting stupid tattoos,’’ she wrote on her website.



‘‘I have now undergone my third laser tattoo removal.’’



Osbourne said the experience was ‘‘horrendously painful’’ and uploaded a photo of her arms, both covered in bandages.



Osbourne, 29, who has previously admitted that she wasn’t happy with all of her tattoos, has advised youngsters not to get any as it’s something they may come to regret.



‘‘Furthermore think before you make ANY permanent decision because its ok to change your mind before its too late! (sic),’’ she wrote.



Osbourne is currently shooting Sharknado 2 with Ian Ziering, Tara Reid and Billy Ray Cyrus.



The film is the follow up to the 2013 original, about a rogue group of sharks that stalk a waterlogged Los Angeles.

Lily Allen blames label for pop songs



Picture: JUSTIN McMANUS

British singer Lily Allen has blamed record label executives for only releasing radio-friendly pop songs as singles after a fan complained about the new tracks on Twitter.



The devotee, named Reg Wilding, voiced his disappointment in a post on Monday after hearing tunes like Our Time, Air Balloon and Hard Out Here from her new album Sheezus.



He wrote: ‘‘lilyallen’s new music is actually docile pop rubbish. So disappointing. She properly (sic) just wrote some rubbish to cash some cheques.’’



The tweet caught the eye of the outspoken Smile hitmaker and she took the unexpected move of replying directly to Wilding, admitting she hasn’t been happy with the single selection either.



However, Allen urged her fan not to give up hope, insisting the rest of her upcoming third album will impress.



She responded to Wilding with ‘‘What you’ve heard so far yes. All I can do is do my best, the labels and the radio stations won’t play the better stuff.’’

For those intoxicated by its debaucherous pleasures, though, the show’s return is something to be celebrated – “Winter is Coming” a favorite way of heralding in the spring. As has become almost a pattern, the fourth season begins somewhat slowly – juggling a dizzying assortment of existing characters, while introducing new ones – punctuated by major events, serving notice nobody lives forever. Even when the pace drags, George R.R. Martin’s creation is consistently as big and brawny as television gets.

As season four begins (in an episode directed by D.B. Weiss, who continues to write most of the hours with fellow showrunner David Benioff), many of the characters are still dealing with the fallout from last season’s “Red Wedding,” as the Lannister clan – under the mercurial leadership of teenage Joffrey (Jack Gleeson), as guided by his Machiavellian grandfather (Charles Dance) – go about consolidating their hold on King’s Landing, celebrating the end of the war.

Like most things pertaining to “Game of Thrones,” however (and rest assured, this review is spoiler-free), victory dances risk being premature, especially with the vague threat massing near the wall to the north, and the Targaryen princess Daenarys (Emilia Clarke) now the proud mother of three dragons roughly the size of Cadillac Escalade.

The Stark children, meanwhile, remain scattered and continue to lick their wounds, with the best material involving the steely young Arya (Maisie Williams), who is traveling in the company of the towering mercenary the Hound (Rory McCann), a relationship that – in the best “Thrones” tradition – mixes disarming comedy with the constant threat of stomach-turning violence.

Martin’s fantasy world, with its ruthless lust for power, is surely not for the faint of heart, and the sheer number of subplots invariably means that one or two start to sag. (The would-be king Stannis Baratheon, played by Stephen Dillane, and his motley entourage would probably be a case in point.)

Such criticisms, however, amount to nitpicking on a show that operates at such a consistently high level, from the spectacular cast to the sweeping and diverse backdrops, consistently conjuring a summer-tentpole feel. While the sword-and-sandal genre has no shortage of iterations in this teeming era of original drama, “Game of Thrones’” mix of serialized storytelling and sumptuous trappings makes it look, to borrow a sports metaphor, like a man among boys.

In that respect, the show’s value to HBO also appears magnified, especially with the news that “Boardwalk Empire” will be concluding after its fifth season; and the fact the genre audience remains the most reliable contingent around in terms of being willing to ante up for that which they like.

Back when “Game of Thrones” premiered, a reporter asked HBO execs – given the scale of Martin’s books, and the fanaticism of their fan base – whether they would commit to at least seven seasons, a question, understandably, that they laughed off at the time.

As it stands now, though, it’s not hard to see the network hanging on for as long as the producers can possibly hold this magnificent beast together. After all, in the best spirit of the Westeros ethos, once you’ve actually managed to tame a dragon, why not take full advantage of it?","To quote an old song, talking about “Game of Thrones” to the uninitiated is like trying to tell a stranger about rock ‘n roll.

Director JJ Abrams and Disney have narrowed down their shortlist, believed by Variety to include Breaking Bad’s Jesse Plemons, Downton’s Ed Speleers, Attack the Block’s John Boyega and theatre actors Ray Fisher and Matthew James Thomas.

Little is known about the character involved, or the rest of the plot. The children of Leia and Han Solo were previously thought to be at the storyline’s centre, but are now said to be in supporting roles in a film that picks up from Return of the Jedi.

Adam Driver, who stars with Lena Dunham in US comedy Girls, looks set to play Star Wars Episode 7’s villain, with Benedict Cumberbatch, Zac Efron, Michael Fassbender and Gary Oldman among other actors linked to the sci-fi movie.

Cumberbatch played villain Khan in 2013's Star Trek Into Darkness and ended the film in cryogenic sleep, meaning his return could be possible. ""That was a stupid thing to do,"" he told the New York Times. ""They should have just blown me up!""

Other rumours include the return of Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in their former roles as Han, Luke and Leia respectively, and even the possible appearance of Pussy Riot members Maria Alyoshina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Hobie Alter has been called the Henry Ford of the surfboard industry. He helped popularize surfing and later sailing. His innovations included the foam surfboard and the lightweight catamaran called the Hobie Cat. Hobie Alter was 80 years old when he passed away at his Southern California home over the weekend. NPR's Nathan Rott has our remembrance.

NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: It's not a stretch to say that all lovers of ocean sports owe a debt to Hobie Alter. Dick Metz, more than most.

DICK METZ: I'd probably still be bartender in Laguna if it hadn't have been Hobie.

ROTT: Metz and Alter became friends when the later was still in high school traveling down to Laguna Beach from his hometown of Ontario during the summers.

METZ: He'd come and see us surfing there and said, that looked pretty good so I'm gonna make myself a surfboard. Well, we soon found out that he could make them a lot better than we could so it just went from there.

ROTT: Alter started building boards in his dad's garage until his dad, a second generation orange grower, got so sick of the banging, the sawing and the balsa shavings that he built a little two-car garage down by the beach.

METZ: And said go down there and make all the noise and dirt you want to and so that became our clubhouse and it soon became the beginning of Hobie's surfboards.

ROTT: The demand for Hobie's surfboards grew faster than they could even get balsa wood, so Alter started developing and mass producing foam and fiberglass surfboards. That changed everything. Movies like ""Endless Summer"" introduced the country to surfing.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The only way to avoid a wipeout is to take this wide stinkbug stance. Spread your legs and hang on till your trunks rip right up the back.

ROTT: And Alter was making the boards for all those new surfers.

METZ: He really started the culture.

ROTT: Alter was never content with the way things were. He was always looking to innovate, to improve. He mass-produced skateboards with clay wheels because they had better traction. He made goggles and glasses with polarized tint and he built a lightweight down-sized catamaran that opened up the world of sailing to anyone with 1,000 bucks and a truck to haul it. His reasoning was always the same.

HOBIE ALTER: I guess you sit out there with nothing to do and you start thinking, I can make one better than that.

ROTT: So he did. Again, Dick Metz.

METZ: You know, he was just a regular guy that was thinking all the time.

ROTT: Hobie Alter is survived by his wife, Susan, three children, eight grandchildren and one great granddaughter. Nathan Rott, NPR News, Culver City, California.

Cameron Diaz is no stranger to flaunting her hot bod, but she is really taking it off in Sex Tape! The actress gets down and dirty with on-screen hubby Jason Segel in the hilarious new rom-com, which sees the pair accidentally blasting out an X-rated home video to everyone they know.

Cameron Diaz & Jason Segel Strip Down For ‘Sex Tape’

Another celebrity sex tape?! Yes, but this time, it’s all in good fun.

Cameron Diaz and How I Met Your Mother‘s Jason Segel star as a couple in the hilarious new comedy Sex Tape, out in theaters July 2014, but an attempt to get their groove back takes a turn for the worse when their homemade video is accidentally blasted out for all to see — really, all is seen.

The Bad Teacher actress (Diaz) tells her on-screen hubby (Segel) that they should make a sex tape to revive their romance. Sounds like a great idea, right? Well, yes…until the X-rated flick is sent out to their friends, family — parents included — and boss (Rob Lowe)!

So how does their plan go awry? The couple had gifted out iPads (sounds pretty nice to us) and when they filmed their scandalous night of rendezvouing, iCloud caught wind of the action and everyone with one of their generous gifts was granted with the greater gift of love!

And apparently, they had a good night. “Who has sex for three hours?” asks their friend, played by the hilarious Rob Corddry. “That’s the length of the movie Lincoln. You did the full Lincoln!”

In the midst of their romance, shots are taken, drugs are blown and dogs go on the attack. Yep. All of that goes down, all in the name of love.

HollywoodLifers, Will you run to theaters to see Sex Tape? Let us know!

11576,1,"Jason and Tiffany Mertlich of Arizona probably didn't expect to get such a big and disappointing reaction when they revealed the sex of their new baby to their three young children.

To reveal the big news about the new baby, the Queen Creek parents decided to bake a gender-revealing cake for their kids and capture their reactions on video.

The video starts with the dad asking his children to guess what sex they think their new sibling will be while they were sitting around a table. The oldest child, Gunner, guessed a boy, his younger sister Pasley said a girl, and the youngest child, Harper, decided to play it safe and said that the new expectancy will be a baby.

However, it all went downhill after a piece of the cake was cut, exposing the pink filling which indicated that the fourth child is going to be a girl.

""It's a girl! Awwwwww .... Awwwww .... I don't want a girl!,"" yelled Gunner who wasn't shy about showing his overwhelming disappointment.

Apparently, Gunner was so disheartened about having a third little sister that he said he didn't even want to eat the cake.

""I don't want to eat the cake,"" he said. ""I don't want a girl cake.""

His father Jason Mertlich, who also said that he wanted a boy, reassured Gunner that he will love his new sister. However, that wasn't enough to cheer Gunner up.

""It's another girl. I hate girls. Every time it's girl, girl, girl, girl. ... I don't want another girl. It's too much girls,"" he said.

Over time, Gunner was able to get over his disappointment, the family told Right This Minute.

""I told him that now he gets to spend all the dad and son time with me and doesn't have to share with anybody,"" Jason Mertlich said.

The YouTube video has garnered over 750,000 views since it was posted on March 22. Watch it below.

11419,1,"It appears that Miley Cyrus' rebellious on-stage behavior could be producing negative affects on her personality ever since it was reported that things didn't go well after meeting a little girl with cancer.

Miley Cyrus Ariana Grande Feud?

On Thursday, Radar Online mentioned that Miley Hodge, a seven-year-old with a dangerous form of bone cancer, had the opportunity to meet a celebrity of her choice when her family reached out to Make-A-Wish. Apparently, the seven-year-old wanted to meet Justin Bieber first, but that didn't work out so she chose Miley Cyrus instead, and according to the report, the visit was not very pleasant.

""From what I know, it was not a very good experience for both of them,"" a source revealed.

Miley Cyrus Dating Justin Bieber?

An acquaintance of the little girl's family supposedly mentioned that the Wrecking Ball singer was more focused on herself than on the girl.

""The family went to Los Angeles and were put off for nearly a week before they met [Cyrus],"" the acquaintance said. ""They finally met at the recording studio and from what I understand, Cyrus was more interested in what she was doing in the studio than paying attention to the little girl.""

The girl's father, Bert, seemed fairly optimistic about the opportunity for his daughter to meet the We Can't Stop star, although he kept that part pretty brief.

""My daughter met one of her idols. Period,"" Bert said.

The family is allegedly hoping that Miley Hodge will have the chance to meet Bieber, her number one celebrity.

""She loves Justin, his music and that he tells her never to give up on her dreams,"" the friend stated. ""Her dream is to meet him one day, only she doesn't have many days left.""

The finale provided many answers for fans -- the most important, of course, being the full story behind the show's mysterious Mother.

The final episode unveiled that the Mother's real name is Tracy McConnell, and that yes, she has passed away by the ""present time"" in 2030, when Ted tells the story. Cristin Milioti, who portrays the Mother, had called the suggestion of her death ""insane"" and ""crazy,"" but fan theories proved true last night when it was revealed the Mother has been gone for six years.

The confirmation of the Mother's passing could have ended the show on an expected but tragic note, but HIMYM chose to continue its focus on love.

""No. I don't buy it. That's not the reason you made us listen to this,"" Ted's daughter Penny says at the end of the story. ""This is a story about how you're totally in love with Aunt Robin and you're thinking about asking her out and you want to know if we're okay with it.""

Ted's children Penny and Luke give him their blessing, and the show ends as Ted arrives at Robin's apartment, blue french horn in hand.

""We had our last table read and I cried puddles of tears,"" actress Cobie Smulders (Robin Scherbatsky) tells CNN of the finale. ""It's such a good group of people, such a great show.""

""I get to play such a wonderful character,"" Smulders continues. ""I'm so blessed and I'm sad to say goodbye, but we've been blessed to be on the air for nine years.""

13847,1,"You know what they say: The couple that wears jewelry together, stays together.

At least that’s what Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are hoping for when it comes to happily ever after.

The heartthrob recently showed off his matching engagement bling, and leave it to Depp to be ahead of the curve when it comes to the ‘man-gagement ring.’

“Johnny and Amber are leading one of the newest trends here,” jewelry expert Michael O’Connor told Celebuzz. “And 17 percent of men today said they would wear an engagement ring. So I doesn’t surprise me from him. He’s not afraid of jewelry and dressing himself. He likes to be on the cutting edge.”

So, of course, Depp wouldn’t settle for anything less than his fashion star wife-to-be, who as CB! exclusively reported got engaged on Christmas Eve.

“These rings may not be exactly the same in every detail, but are inspired by a similar enough look, each with slight differences that symbolizes the uniqueness of each,” O’Connor added.

So let’s get to the decadent details.

Both are round brilliant cut diamonds, according to our expert. Depp is donning roughly a 5-carat diamond, while Heard’s is approximately 3 carats, he estimates.

But that’s not all. Both big center baubles have pave diamonds on each side, bringing the totals to about 7 carats and 4 carats… for a grand total of $125,000 and $80,000, respectively.

We all knew the Don Juan DeMarco of the big screen was a hopeless romantic and now he’s a seriously a big spender. But what’s money when you’re as in love as these two clearly are.

“With his hand size compared to hers, there has to be a disparity,” added O’Connor.

“The diamond-set platinum mountings symbolize the unchanging nature of love, as the platinum will remain white and unchanged for life. And the cut is supposed to maximize the sparkle of the diamond.”

Close friends and family of the gorgeous couple like Marilyn Manson, Steven Tyler and Mandy Moore first got to see their impeccable taste in jewelry at their intimate engagement party March 14 in downtown L.A.","At least that’s what Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are hoping for when it comes to happily ever after.

Neil Patrick Harris says Cristin Milioti made him cry with her performance in the finale of 'How I Met Your Mother'.

31 March 2014

The sitcom is coming to an end after nine series at the end of March in the US and Neil - who plays ladies man Barney Stinson in the show - said the final scenes stirred strong emotions with him.



He said: ""We never talked about the end. Josh Radnor has never been funnier and Cristin Milioti made me cry.""



Neil, 40, also admitted he'd coerced the show's producers to tell him how the show concludes when he was tipsy.



He added: ""After, like, five drinks, I cornered our producers at our Christmas party and said, 'Spill the beans. Tell me how it all ends.' And they did. It' more complicated than you'd assume. Fans won't be disappointed.""



The star - who has twins Harper and Gideon, three, with his partner David Burtka - also added his favourite moment was when Barney and Robin, Cobie Smulders' character, married.



He added to Us Weekly magazine: ""Saying my vows with Robin [was my favourite]. This whole season has been great, spending time with Cobie and to appreciate the wedding.""

7867,1,"Poor Bachelor Juan Pablo, the charming single dad has gotten pounded in the media. You would think he was on the FBI’s Top Ten Most Wanted List, why are Bachelor fans such haters? Is Bachelor Juan Pablo just misunderstood or is our single daddy a stone cold player? Here’s our latest astrology psychic predictions.

First off, Astrochicks thinks fans forget this is JUST A TV SHOW! In fact, most girls would swoon if a guy like Bachelor Juan Pablo asked them out. A responsible single father, a former professional soccer player, a handsome guy, who knows how to salsa. Where do I sign up?

Bachelor Juan Pablo a Leo, we think is probably surprised by all the nasty backlash. Unfortunately, social media and blogs like Astrochicks, lets cranky fans hide behind their computers and post horrible comments about someone they’ve never met.

Yes, Bachelor Juan Pablo made some “off the cuff” comments, we definitely don’t agree with everything he said, but Astrochicks has personally met men + women, 100 x worse than this Latin hunk. Hollywood is full of them.

Astrologically speaking, Bachelor Juan Pablo we feel is disillusioned by love and may regret his final rose decision. According to Reality Steve, he chooses Nikki but there’s trouble in paradise. For Astrochicks, we think he seemed more in love with Clare and not Nikki. What happened?

Our Astrology prediction is Bachelor Juan Pablo and Nikki will split. In fact, we think he will return to the loving arms of his baby mama. Hang in there JP, your 15 minutes of fame are almost up.

13883,1,"Do me a favor, take a gander at this gent and ask yourself: Could he possible have an amazing, soul voice?

The answer is absolutely 100% yes. This is Josh Kaufman. This guy packs a huge punch. He has one of the best voices that I have heard in a VERY long time. Tonight he showcased the soul filled side of his voice. While I was disappointed that he was not picked by his coach, I am very excited that Kaufman was stolen immediately by (you guessed it) Team Usher! I know I’ve said this a million times, but for real… Team Usher is a force to be reckoned with this season. This season’s winner of “The Voice” will be coming from Team Usher. I can feel it.

Anyways, back to Josh Kaufman. If you missed his performance of “Signed, Sealed, Delivered,” tonight — do yourself a favor and watch this right now.

After you picked your jaw off the ground, I’m sure you also asked yourself these questions:

1.) How does that voice come out of that fellow?

2. ) Why in the world would Adam not pick him?

3.) How precious is he?

You didn’t ask yourself #3? Psh. You did. Admit it. I’m not the only one out there that was very impressed with Josh Kaufman tonight. Social media was lighting up with praise for Josh.

While I think that Adam made a big error tonight, I think Josh Kaufman is just one more reason why Team Usher has major potential to totally upset the competition this season. Not only does Josh have an amazing voice, but he is a family man and I think that America is totally in love with that. He is a 38 year old husband and father who also is a struggling musician. He is trying one last time to make a name for himself in music while he tutors high school students. Yikes, come on people. Don’t send him back to the torture that must be tutoring high school students to pass standardize tests. I’m sure he is great at what he does, but Kaufman wants to be, “The Voice” (not “The Tutor”). Are you rallying behind Josh Kaufman?

In case you need any more convincing, I am going to leave you with Josh Kaufman’s audition song choice. This version is better than the original in my opinion. You’re welcome for getting it stuck in your head too!

Seven-year-old Josh Hardy made headlines when drug manufacturer Chimerix refused to donate an antiviral drug - still in the experimental phase - to the cancer-stricken child. However, the company has now reneged on its original decision, announcing Tuesday that Josh would form part of a new pilot study where he would be required to test the medication. Josh will be the first of 20 patients involved in the study.

A Facebook campaign (#Savejosh) saw thousands of supporters rising to the occasion, putting pressure on Chimerix to donate brincidofovir to Josh. The drug is still undergoing clinical trials and is yet to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), hence the need for the donation on compassionate grounds by the manufacturer. However, 'compassionate grounds' proves to be a difficult and morally fraught scenario for drug manufacturers, who believe that giving the drug to one patient opens floodgates to all patients with similar conditions. In the case of brincidofovir, its effectiveness and safety haven't yet been verified in children, leaving the company with several initial reservations about giving it to Josh.

Josh, a four-time cancer survivor, requires the antiviral due to a bone marrow transplant that left him with an attack of adenovirus infection, with the child suffering from serious heart and kidney failure.

Ken Moch, CEO of Chimerix, explained the process of a compassionate donation, saying that his company has not participated in such a program for some two years. ""Making an experimental drug, which currently has limited clinical evidence, available outside of controlled clinical trials has the potential to slow or derail our ability to make brincidofovir available as soon as possible to the thousands of patients each year who might benefit from it,"" Moch told PEOPLE Magazine. ""This is why we are focused on demonstrating the safety and efficacy of brincidofovir in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial.""

In deciding to allow Josh access to the drug, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, where Josh is being treated, has urged his family and supporters to remain realistic about the results. ""This drug is experimental and has not yet been approved by the FDA and the safety and effectiveness of the medication has not yet been established for use in children,"" the hospital said in a statement. ""It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation.""

Josh's mother, Aimee Hardy, expressed her gratitude in a Facebook post: ""Glory to GOD! They are releasing the drug for Josh!!!!!!!!!""

20326,2,"Harold P. Wimmer is national president and chief executive of the American Lung Association.

It is long past time for the Food and Drug Administration to advance common sense steps to safeguard the public from all tobacco products. Three years ago, the F.D.A. indicated that it would assert authority over all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and cigars, but it wasn’t until April 24 that the public finally saw its proposal.

We have many reasons to be encouraged by this first step. Tobacco product manufacturers will be required to register with the F.D.A., disclose product ingredients and refrain from making unproven health claims without full F.D.A. review. Free samples will be stopped. Retailers will be prohibited from selling all tobacco products to kids, and vending machines will be eliminated in almost all locations. These are important steps but much more is needed.

The extended regulatory delay is contributing to another generation of Americans’ tobacco addiction.

That’s because the largest cigarette companies were able to capitalize on the three-year delay by jumping into the e-cigarette business. E-cigarette companies have revived some truly repugnant past tobacco marketing tactics – cartoons, celebrities, candy flavors and health claims – to promote their unregulated new product. Further, e-cigarettes are available to kids everywhere – online and in stores. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows e-cigarette use by children has doubled in just one year. The extended regulatory delay is contributing to another generation of Americans’ tobacco addiction.

The F.D.A.’s proposal not only addresses e-cigarettes but also all other unregulated products including little cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah, dissolvables and nicotine gels. At the Lung Association we were alarmed to see that the F.D.A. proposed exempting certain cigars from any regulation. To protect public health, we strongly believe the agency must not exempt any tobacco products from meaningful oversight.

The Obama administration must act quickly to complete these initial rules by the end of 2014. Then the F.D.A. must build on them and propose rules to close the Internet sales loophole, eliminate candy and fruit flavors that attract kids, and require companies to alter their products to help reduce tobacco’s lethal toll. Each day of delay in finalizing this proposal means more newly addicted children and more disease, death and misery.

Cases of syphilis in the United States are again on the rise, according to a recent federal report. The rise in cases of the sexual transmitted disease is seen almost entirely among men, who currently make up 91 percent of all US cases.

According to a recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) out from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of cases of syphilis in the US have doubled since 2005.

According to CDC investigators, a total of 16,663 cases of the potentially debilitating sexual disease were identified in the US in 2013. The rate of infection that same year was 5.3 cases per 100,000 citizens -- a rate more than double the lowest rate ever seen in the U.S. back in 2000, which was 2.1 cases per 100,000 citizens.

In 2000, the CDC nearly achieved its goal of completely eliminating syphilis from the country, declaring that ""syphilis elimination history was in the making,"" by November of 2001. However, things soon turned for the worse, and by 2006 the CDC was reporting that the country had hit an all-time high, with more than 36,000 cases of the dangerous bacterial infection.

According to the CDC, syphilis is a potentially debilitating disease that can be transmitted through sexual activity. Past reports have shown that the disease can even be transmitted through prolonged kissing, as the disease is spread through vulnerable contact with sores - the vast majority of which can go unnoticed.

If left untreated, the disease - which results from an infection of the bacteria Treponema pallidum - can result in serious long-term health problems such as brain damage and blindness.

According to the MMWR report, syphilis rates of infection shortly fell and then stabilized in the US between 2009 and 2010. However, by 2011, the rates of infection began to again see an alarming rate of rise, with the disease primarily affecting the homosexual community.

In an effort to again stall the rising rate of infection, CDC investigators recommend that general practitioners and health clinic increase their rate of syphilis screenings among male patients, especially among those who report having sex with other men.

Public outreach programs were also recommended, promoting aid and partner-notification programs among the homosexual community.

The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report was published for the week of May 9.","Cases of syphilis in the United States are again on the rise, according to a recent federal report.

16592,2,"Before and after pictures showing how a 3D printer has been used to rebuild a man's face have been released by scientists in Wales.

Stephen Power, a 29-year-old father of one, suffered from extensive injuries after he crashed his motorbike in September 2012.

He broke both arms and ne needed a bone graft on his right leg. Both his cheek bones, eye sockets and upper jaw also broke and his skull fractured.

Surgeons treating Power at Morriston Hospital were able to repair most of his facial injuries, other than his left cheek and eye.

""We fixed his facial fractures pretty well but he had damaged his left eye and the ophthalmologists did not want us to do anything that might damage his sight further. Consultant maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar said.

""That was a good move because his eyesight has mostly recovered. But as a result we did not get his left cheekbone in the right place and we did not even try to reconstruct the very thin bones around his eye socket.

""So the result was that his cheekbone was too far out and his eye was sunk in and dropped.""

Researchers at the Centre for Applied Reconstructive Technologies in Surgery working in partnership with Morriston Hospital and Cardiff Metropolitan University then went about planning surgery to reconstruct Power's face.

The team used scanned images of his face to cut and position the bones. All models, including the implants, were created using a 3D printer.

""Stephen had a very complex injury and correcting it involved bones having to be re-cut into several fragments,"" Sugar said. ""Being able to do that and to put them back in the right position was a complex three dimensional exercise. It made sense to plan it in three dimensions and that is why 3D printing came in – and successive 3D printing, as at every different stage we had a model.

""Stephen's eye is now a little bit raised, but that might settle over the next few months. Apart from that, his cheekbone is in a good position and the prominence of the eye is much better.

""He has given us nine out of 10 – a good assessment and one I agree with. I'm glad he's not given us 10 because if he did, we would not have any way of getting better.""

After the operation, Power said: ""To be honest I thought they did a good job in the beginning anyway because of how bad my accident was. But from this operation I can't really explain how well it has gone. It has just made me look a lot better. I take my hat off to them.""","Before and after pictures showing how a 3D printer has been used to rebuild a man's face have been released by scientists in Wales.

18444,2,"The Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea appears to have spread to Liberia and Canada, experts have warned.

A Canadian tourist returning from Liberia has been hospitalised with Ebola-like symptoms. He is being held in isolation and is in a critical condition at a hospital in Saskatoon, the largest city in Saskatchewan province.

A medical official said the man had symptoms of haemorrhagic fever resembling the Ebola virus, adding he posed no risk to the public.

His admission to hospital follows an Ebola outbreak in Guinea, where at least 59 people have died from the disease in southern Guinea.

Laboratory tests are yet to confirm the virus is Ebola in Liberia or Canada. ""All we know at this point is that we have a person who is critically ill who travelled from a country where these diseases occur,"" Denise Werker, joint director of health in Saskatchewan, told reporters.

She said the patient had developed symptoms after landing in Canada and would not have been contagious during the journey back home. The World Health Organisation said it is awaiting his test results from Canadian officials.

If the Canadian tourist is confirmed as having Ebola, it will be the first case of the pathogen spreading to another country: ""There is no risk to the general public,"" Werker added. ""We recognise that there is going to be a fair amount of concern and that is why we wanted to go public with this as soon as possible.""

In Liberia, health officials are investigating five deaths after a group of people crossed the border from Guinea looking for medical treatment. Investigators are currently collecting blood samples to test for Ebola.

Currently, health officials in neighbouring Sierra Leone are on high alert and have sent medical teams to the Guinean border, although there have been no cases reported yet.

Ibrahima Toure, the Guinea director of aid group, Plan International, said: ""The Ebola fever is one of the most virulent diseases known to mankind with a fatality rate up to 90%. Communities in the affected region stretch across the borders and people move freely within this area. This poses a serious risk of the epidemic becoming widespread with devastating consequences.""

The Ebola outbreak in Guinea is the first to be recorded in West Africa for 20 years. The disease causes severe hemorrhagic fever. It is spread from human to human and symptoms include the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and a sore throat.

""This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. Laboratory findings show low counts of white blood cells and platelets as well as elevated liver enzymes,"" WHO said.","The Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea appears to have spread to Liberia and Canada, experts have warned.

19935,2,"There's been a lot of understandable contempt directed at the anti-vaccination crowd in this country because of the latter's efforts to bring back Diseases Of The 19th Century as a regular American miniseries. Meanwhile, around the world, diseases are kicking our ass. In Saudi Arabia, there's an outbreak of what is being called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, a deadly coronavirus similar to SARS. It's also apparently spreadingaround the world; cases are turning up as far away as Malaysia and Indonesia.

There have been 350 cases and more than 100 deaths reported worldwide from the virus, although the World Health Organization (WHO) has laboratory-confirmed only 254 cases with 93 deaths. Most of the reported infections have come from Middle East countries including Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. While public health experts have been tracking the disease for nearly two years, in recent weeks health officials are reporting a sharp rise in cases. The WHO reported at least 78 confirmed cases since the beginning of the year, and that diagnosed cases sharply increased in mid-March.

Apparently, the disease begins in the camel population and then spreads to humans. It also appears to be spread by human-to-human contact, as many of the victims are health-care workers who are working with MERS patients.

""The younger animals have the virus and become infected and become little virus factories,"" said Lipkin, who explained that camels are extremely common in Saudi Arabia and surrounding countries. ""It's almost like dogs in the U.S. Except they eat the camels ... there's so much opportunity,"" for the virus to spread, he said.

Elsewhere, there's a massive Ebola outbreak in west Africa that already has killed over 100 people and is still spreading.

There are several theories explaining the outbreak, Africa's worst in seven years and the first to kill in the continent's west. One was published last week in the New England Journal that established ""the emergence of a new EBOV strain in Guinea,"" which had ""evolved in parallel"" to other disease veins.

Our political system, of course, is not in any way prepared for what might happen if one of these little lovelies hops a plane to LAX or somewhere. Sequestration, that brilliant idea meant to force ""hard choices"" on the government, beat hell out of the Centers For Disease Control. The budget agreement struck by Senator Patty Murray and Paul Ryan, the zombie-eyed granny starver from the state of Wisconsin, didn't improve things very much. Meanwhile, microbes march on.

25411,2,"Promises of fast weight loss usually either come from diet pills ads or with warnings that you’re actually just losing water weight and that you’ll gain it all back, if not more, in a heartbeat.

But a new study published in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Sports suggests that a low calorie and high-intensity exercise plan can actually reduce body fat in just four days. And unlike other fast diets, the weight loss actually seems to last for months.

This fast 4-day weight loss plan is just as it sounds: low cal + extended exercise = difficult.

The 4-Day, 11-Pound Weight Loss Plan:

The study tracked 15 overweight but otherwise healthy men (ages 18-55) from Spain and Sweden. Their plan was simple but grueling.

1. A very low calorie diet – they only ate 360 calories per day. They were allowed to drink as much of a low-calorie hydrating drink throughout the day as they needed/wanted.

2. A full day of exercise, usually about 45 minutes of upper body exercise and eight hours of walking through the Swedish countryside.

Average weight loss: 11 pounds, about half from body fat

Real Weight Loss in One Week? Two Surprising Study Results:

1. No one dropped out and the men didn’t find it torture. The four-day plan sounds like a surefire way to hallucinate, with all that walking on very little food and calories per day. However, the New York Times reported that the subjects found the four days easier than expected.

According to José Calbet, a professor at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in Spain, ‘they were surprised that it was easier than they thought it would be,’ with common issues being joint pain and blisters (as opposed to an inescapable craving for mac & cheese).

2. The men did not immediately gain the weight back, and even kept it off after a few months. Some even lost more weight after the study ended.

According to Dr. Calbet, the only explanation they could come up with was that:

the men were inspired by their hypercompressed success to change their lifestyles. The men moved more and ate less than before.

Very interesting, and we’re looking forward to a repeat performance by this research team, as they want to repeat this study with female subjects.","Promises of fast weight loss usually either come from diet pills ads or with warnings that you’re actually just losing water weight and that you’ll gain it all back, if not more, in a heartbeat.

19786,2,"(CNN) — Inspiration can come from unlikely places. Brian Flemming found the will to change his life in a drawing game.

Flemming was addicted to alcohol, severely morbidly obese and full of self-pity when he met Jackie Eastham through a random match on Draw Something, the Pictionary-like mobile game. It was the spring of 2012. Most nights Flemming drank around a fifth of vodka mixed with a liter of soda while he zoned out in front of the TV.

The last time he had been weighed, on a special scale at the hospital, he was 625 pounds.

Eastham lived in England and was 20 years Flemming’s senior. At first, the players shared casual banter between rounds. Their friendship eventually moved to Facebook, where they began to confide in each other.

Flemming was at a low point. Besides being an alcoholic and morbidly obese, he was pre-diabetic and had a recurring cellulitis infection.

Eastham was the first person he was totally honest with — no one in his life knew about the drinking. He expected sympathy.

But she wasn’t having it.

“She said there were people struggling for their lives and then there’s you — you have all these opportunities and you’re throwing it all away,” said Flemming, 32, now a business relations representative and part-time music teacher in Canton, Michigan.

It was personal for Eastham, who lives with myotonic dystrophy, an inherited type of muscular dystrophy that causes progressive muscle weakness and can affect various systems and organs. Her symptoms have been relatively mild so far, but she never takes her health for granted.

“I just thought bloody hell, you’re a guy who’s 30 … and you’re wasting your life,” she said, remembering how she felt as the recipient of his drunken, maudlin messages. “My future is a lot gloomier. I’m trying to make the brightest future I can, and … you’re dragging yourself down.”

It was the wake-up call Flemming needed. He’d show her he could change. That day — October 13, 2012 — he vowed to quit drinking cold turkey.

That was the first step toward what would become a remarkable transformation. Less than two years later, Flemming has lost more than 380 pounds from his 6 foot 2 frame. He went from a size 60 waist to a size 38.

The days after he gave up alcohol were grueling, he said. He had cold sweats, shaky hands and couldn’t sleep. He kept busy to distract himself and found comfort in daily chats with Eastham.

They progressed from Facebook to Skype video chats, where Eastham said she was initially shocked by his size.

The weight began to fall off. Without the extra calories from alcohol, Flemming lost 100 pounds in a couple months. That was motivation enough to make other changes. He had been consuming upwards of 7,000 calories a day, according to an app he used to record his meals. He stopped eating fast food and cut out sugar and red meat.

Now, a typical day for Flemming starts with a few ounces of low or no-sodium turkey breast, a serving of dry cereal, a bowl of non-fat Greek yogurt with artificial sweetener and a glass of low-sodium vegetable juice.

For lunch and dinner, he often eats chicken and vegetables with rice. And every Friday night, he treats himself to a scoop of ice cream. Now that he’s doing more exercise, he’s not as strict about his diet.

Adding in physical activity was a gradual process. Flemming says he began by walking in place in his parents’ basement for five minutes a day every morning, adding minutes as he felt ready. When he was finally comfortable to exercise outside, he only went when it was dark and the neighbors couldn’t see him. Eastham kept him company on Skype sometimes while he walked.

“She was a huge motivation. She’d try to push me to walk a little further each time,” he said.

In July 2013, he walked his first half-marathon. Shortly after that he took up cycling, and then running, completing his third 5-kilometer run on his birthday a few weeks ago. He used running and calorie tracker apps to stay accountable and started seeing a psychotherapist to manage his depression and make sure he was approaching his weight loss in a healthy way.

Eastham said she encouraged it, not wanting him to be dependent on their friendship to stay sober and motivated.

Flemming is now down to 234 pounds, with about 30 pounds of excess skin around his waist. He’s trying to save the money for surgery to have it removed.

This past December, he went to Europe and finally met Eastham in person, where he was able to climb the Eiffel Tower after barely being able to walk up a flight of stairs less than two years earlier. They continue to talk every day — and are still playing Draw Something.

Flemming now hopes to go back to school to become a therapist specializing in weight loss, depression and anxiety.

“Jackie is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I feel that she saved my life, even though she would never take credit,” Flemming wrote in a blog post.

“Brian is so inspiring,” Eastham said. “I hope he gets what he wants out of life.”

Researchers are asking 18,000 men and women around the nation to take part in a study to see if chocolate can help prevent heart attacks and strokes, according to the Associated Press.

Scientists have created chocolate pills that are packed full of nutrients but without the sugar and fat. The research will be the first large-scale study to test cocoa flavanols, which previous studies have shown improved blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

Participants in the study will receive either placebos or cocoa flavanol pills for four years. The flavanol capsules will have no taste, so neither the participants or researchers will know whether they are taking a placebo or flavanol pill.

“Cocoa flavanols and multivitamins are two of the most promising and exciting nutritional interventions available, and this new randomized trial is the natural next step in advancing our understanding of their potential benefits,” JoAnn Manson, MD, chief of the division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said in a statement. “In smaller studies, cocoa flavanols have been linked to improvements in intermediate risk factors for heart disease, such as reductions in blood pressure and cholesterol levels, improvements in the body’s sensitivity to insulin, and improved ability of blood vessels to dilate.”

Researchers will also be using the study to test multivitamins that could help prevent cancer. While previous studies have shown there is a benefit to these multivitamins in older healthy men, the team wants to test this on a broader population.

Howard Sesso, who will co-lead the trial alongside Manson, said the exact mechanisms behind multivitamins that leads to lower cancer risks remains unclear, but could be due to individual and joint effects of more than 20 vitamins and minerals.

“This supplement has shown favorable results in research to date, but the proposed randomized trial is needed to provide conclusive evidence,” Sesso, who is also in the division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said in a statement.

Women who are going to participate in the study are being pulled from a large nation-wide Women’s Health Initiative, while men are being recruited from other large population-based studies.

According to the researchers, Mars Incorporated will be one of the financial providers for the study, along with the Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of National Institutes of Health.

“This collaboration represents the best of a public-private partnership in the interest of advancing science and public health. It’s exciting to be at this turning point in scientific discovery where we have the potential to achieve benefits for some of our most significant health challenges today,” Harold Schmitz, Ph.D, Chief Science Officer at Mars, Incorporated, said in a statement.

25582,2,"Earlier this month, New York's attorney general announced that every cop who patrols the state's transit system will carry a life-saving drug to give people who are overdosing on heroin. Now, New York City's police force is following suit

The state attorney general's office will provide about $1.1 million in funding to equip 19,500 NYPD officers with the drug and train them on how to use it.

That drug, naloxone, is sprayed into the nose or injected into the body to counteract the effects of an opioid overdose and allow a person to breathe normally.

When people take heroin, it converts into morphine in the brain, where it binds to opioid receptors. When too many opioids attach to receptors on the brain stem, which controls critical automatic processes like respiration and blood pressure, ""people just slowly stop breathing,"" as the physician Robert Hoffman has written in The New York Times.

To counteract an overdose, naloxone pushes opioids away from the brain's opioid receptors long enough to restore normal breathing for the victim.

There are few, if any, drawbacks to naloxone. If it turns out opioids are not in a person's system, naloxone has no effect on the body. It is non-addictive, and civilians with little training can administer it if emergency workers or police aren't available.

Once distributed to drug users, their families, healthcare workers, and others, the drug is used very effectively. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed 48 U.S. programs that made naloxone available to 53,000 people who could administer it between 1996 and 2010, and it found that there were 10,171 overdose reversals.

""Providing opioid overdose education and naloxone to persons who use drugs and to persons who might be present at an opioid overdose can help reduce opioid overdose mortality, a rapidly growing public health concern,"" the CDC said in that 2012 report.

In 2010, the police department in Quincy, Massachusetts, became the first in the country that requires officers to carry naloxone. As of this February, the police department has administered naloxone 221 times and reversed 211 overdoses, a 95% success rate, according to New York's attorney general.

The use of naloxone is rising as more people realize its benefits.

Last month, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick declared opioid use in his state a public health emergency and ordered police to use Narcan, a brand of the naloxone medication. A police officer and EMT there said he's seen overdose victims who have turned blue from not breathing ""get up and walk out to the ambulance,"" moments after naloxone is administered, substance.com reported.

The federal government has also begun championing the overdose-reversal medication. In March, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called for more law enforcement agencies to supply their members with naloxone.","Earlier this month, New York's attorney general announced that every cop who patrols the state's transit system will carry a life-saving drug to give people who are overdosing on heroin.

25734,2,"My friend Lauren, a general practitioner, sometimes feels like her main competition is Dr. Wikipedia; patients arrive at her clinic having diagnosed themselves using information from the Internet. And she claims plenty of those patients are wrong.

She’s probably not the only doctor to feel that way. According to a Pew Research Center study, one in three Americans have gone online to find out what medical condition they or someone else has. And a study published this month in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association also suggests Lauren is right about the inaccuracy of layman medical research.

Researchers looked at Wikipedia entries on the 10 most costly medical conditions in the United States (in terms of public and private expenditure), checking them against peer-reviewed medical research.

They found that nine of 10 of them had “statistically significant discordance” with medical literature. The basic conclusion: Wikipedia articles about medical conditions “contain many errors.” (The researchers didn’t judge Wikipedia entries by what they didn’t say, so errors of omission weren’t counted.)

Who are the most likely people to go online in search of health information? Let’s go back to the Pew study. In 2012, Pew surveyed 3,014 adults and found that 81 percent used the Internet. Among Internet users, 72 percent said they had looked online for health information.

There were some interesting demographic patterns. Among those on the Internet, women were more likely than men and white Americans were more likely than other racial groups to seek out health information. (Pew was careful to emphasize that this was statistically significant, because it was calculated as a percentage of all Internet users in each of those subgroups.)

Given the latest study showing the fallibility of online sources such as Wikipedia, it’s worth noting that 53 percent of online diagnosers follow up with a medical professional. So, at least some of these people are seeing doctors like Lauren, who can tell them when Dr. Google and Dr. Wikipedia are wrong.","My friend Lauren, a general practitioner, sometimes feels like her main competition is Dr. Wikipedia; patients arrive at her clinic having diagnosed themselves using information from the Internet.

24564,2,"Another day at the office might be particularly stressful for some. Yet recent research shows that even the majority of Americans who complain about their jobs may find it less taxing than their home environment.

""We found a big gender difference,"" said Sarah Damaske, a sociologist and women's studies professor at Penn State and one of the report authors, via The Washington Post. ""Women were much happier at work than at home. And men were only moderately happier at home than at work.""

For the study, researchers tested cortisol levels in 122 participants, also known as a biological hallmark of stress. To do so, researchers used swabs for saliva samples six times a day for three days. Findings showed what many might not have thought: The most relaxing part of the day for most people is at the office, not at home.

""Further contradicting conventional wisdom, we found that women as well as men have lower levels of stress at work than at home,"" wrote Sarah Damaske, Assistant Professor of Labor & Employment Relations, Sociology, and Women's Studies at Penn State, via pbs.org. ""In fact, women may get more renewal from work than men, because unlike men, they report themselves happier at work than at home. It is men, not women, who report being happier at home than at work.""

Besides testing saliva samples, researchers also asked participants about how they felt throughout the study period. As men typically reported no changes throughout the day, women were more likely to be significantly happier at work than at home, due to certain factors.

A slew of seemingly endless household chores comes to mind. At home, there may be less equated gender roles than in the office.

20267,2,"Healthcare worker who contracted Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in Saudi Arabia, has been hospitalized since 28 April

Health officials said Monday they expect the first patient in the United States diagnosed with a mysterious virus from the Middle East to be released soon from an Indiana hospital, though he could continue to be isolated at home.

The man has been hospitalized at a Munster hospital since 28 April. Officials said he fell ill with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or Mers, after flying to the US last month from Saudi Arabia, where he is a healthcare worker.

Indiana State Department of Health Commissioner William VanNess II said during a news conference with officials from the hospital and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday that no health workers or family members who've had contact with the patient have tested positive for the virus. The virus has an incubation period of two to 14 days.

About 50 hospital employees had contact with the patient before he was placed in isolation, said Alan Kumar, chief medical information officer at Community Hospital.

The man flew from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to the United States on 24 April, with a stop in London. He landed in Chicago and took a bus to Indiana, health officials said.

Mers belongs to the coronavirus family that includes the common cold and Sars, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which caused some 800 deaths globally in 2003.

Saudi Arabia has been at the center of a Middle East outbreak of Mers that began two years ago. The virus has spread among health care workers, most notably at four facilities in that county last spring.

Officials said Monday the patient did not recall working directly with a Mers patient in Riyadh but said the hospital where he worked did have some Mers cases.

Overall, at least 400 people have had the respiratory illness, and more than 100 people have died. All had ties to the Middle East region or to people who traveled there.

Officials say it isn't highly contagious, but there is no cure.

The Mers virus has been found in camels, but officials don't know how it is spreading to humans. It can spread from person to person, but officials believe that happens only after close contact. Not all those exposed to the virus become ill.","Officials said he fell ill with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or Mers, after flying to the US last month from Saudi Arabia, where he is a healthcare worker.

25041,2,"Edgar Hernandez didn’t expect to learn that he was pre-diabetic at age 16.

When his mother burst into tears at the doctor’s office, it hit him hard. He was 370 pounds and couldn’t stand to look at himself.

It was tough being a fat kid, but things became unbearable in high school. Edgar was seeing a therapist for depression symptoms. He was frequently bullied in gym class. Kids would point at his “fat wobbling everywhere,” especially as he struggled to keep up.

“I tried my best to ignore it. But there were times when I just gave in and started crying,” said Edgar, who lives in a suburb of St. Louis and is now 18.

Everyone in his family had a weight problem; his parents developed type 2 diabetes in their forties. But Edgar was the biggest.

“He would eat two really big burritos or sandwiches a day, packed with cheese, sour cream, a lot of bread, butter,” his older brother Mario said. “He would be watching TV, playing video games.”

After receiving the sobering blood test result at the doctor’s office, Edgar went home and cried. And then something new happened: He owned up to his weight problem.

“It was time to stop blaming others for my choices and make a choice to take responsibility,” he said.

He dried his tears, threw on his jacket and began jogging. He only got about half a mile before he stopped and threw up.

That was a year and a half ago. Edgar, who is 5-foot-9, went on to drop nearly 200 pounds. He now weighs 185 pounds. He has traded his double-XL shirts and size 48 pants for medium T-shirts and 33-inch pants.

It happened slowly at first.

After that gut-impulse jog in November 2012, Edgar started walking before or after school. As he could, he added distance until he was walking about two miles a day. He started to incorporate running intervals until, months later, he could run a full mile.

The weight began to come off, but the teen wasn’t seeing as much progress as he had hoped. It was his older brother, Mario, who helped him kick the weight loss into high gear.

Mario, who carried 235 pounds on his 5-foot-7 frame, was inspired by Edgar’s will to change. He took Edgar to the grocery store and together they overhauled the family’s pantry. Chicken breasts and fresh produce replaced the processed foods and sodas that were once the staple at home, Mario said.

Edgar’s typical breakfast became a peanut butter sandwich with honey and banana slices. Dinners usually featured a chicken breast with two cups of broccoli. He didn’t have a specific diet or calorie count; it was all about portion sizes, the teen said.

The brothers became each other’s support. They started running together in January 2013, buying sweatpants and thermal gear to keep them warm in the Illinois weather.

Mario has lost 70 pounds and continues to run alongside his brother, Edgar said.

The brothers, who live at home with their parents, have seen their weight loss inspire some changes for the whole family, Mario said. The family has cut down on eating out — once every couple of weeks, as opposed to four to five times a week.

“As a family, we go outside more, walk a little more. It shows because we have a lot more energy,” Mario said. “Even though other members haven’t lost as much weight, maybe five pounds, you can see it in their faces.”

These days, Edgar can’t get enough of running. His favorite activities are heavy cardio and weightlifting. The teen even ran his first half-marathon in April, and he’s planning another one soon.

“Running is what made me feel happy; I had gotten what they call ‘runner’s high’ and now running has become a lifestyle,” he said.

Edgar has also found his calling in his new healthy lifestyle. He will start college at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville in the fall and plans to study exercise science.

For Mario, watching his little brother shed the pounds at such a young age has been a source of pride.

“If you would have told me three years ago that he’d be running a half-marathon, I wouldn’t believe you,” Mario said. “You see a completely different person that’s a lot happier, has more energy and is more active.”

Edgar couldn’t agree more.

“I wouldn’t even step out my door to get the mail before,” he said. “People don’t see the dark, sad side of me anymore. They see a bright, happy kid.”

For the people out there looking to lose weight, the teenager has the following advice: Don’t put it off. If you say you’re going to run, do it today, not tomorrow.

“Don’t wait, because it will get worse,” he said. “You’ll start putting it off until something serious happens and when something serious happens, it will change your life.”

After that gut-impulse jog in November 2012, Edgar started walking before or after school.
It was his older brother, Mario, who helped him kick the weight loss into high gear.
They started running together in January 2013, buying sweatpants and thermal gear to keep them warm in the Illinois weather.
Mario has lost 70 pounds and continues to run alongside his brother, Edgar said.","['edgar hernandez expect learn age', 'when mother burst tear doctor office hit hard', 'he pound stand look', 'it tough fat kid thing become unbearable high school', 'edgar see therapist depression symptom', 'he frequently bully gym class', 'kid would point fat wobble everywhere especially struggle keep', 'i try best ignore', 'but time i give start cry say edgar live suburb louis', 'everyone family weight problem parent developed type diabetes forty', 'but edgar big', 'he would eat two really big burrito sandwich day packed cheese sour cream lot bread butter old brother mario say', 'he would watch tv playing video game', 'after receive sober blood test result doctor office edgar go home cry', 'and something new happen he own weight problem', 'it time stop blame others choice make choice take responsibility say', 'he dry tear throw jacket begin jogging', 'he get half mile stop throw', 'that year half ago', 'edgar go drop nearly pound', 'he weigh pound', 'he trade shirt size pant medium pant', 'it happen slowly first', 'after jog november edgar start walk school', 'as could add distance walk two mile day', 'he start incorporate run interval month later could run full mile', 'the weight begin come teen see much progress hop', 'it old brother mario help kick weight loss high gear', 'mario carry pound frame inspired edgar change', 'he take edgar grocery store together overhaul family pantry', 'chicken breast fresh produce replace process food soda staple home mario say', 'edgar typical breakfast become peanut butter sandwich honey banana slice', 'dinner usually featured chicken breast two cup broccoli', 'he specific diet calorie count portion size teen say', 'the brother become support', 'they start run together january buying sweatpants thermal gear keep warm illinois weather', 'mario lose pound continue run alongside brother edgar say', 'the brother live home parent see weight loss inspire change whole family mario say', 'the family cut eating every couple week oppose four five time week', 'as family go outside walk little', 'it show lot energy mario say', 'even though member lose much weight maybe five pound see face', 'these day edgar get enough run', 'his favorite activity heavy cardio weightlifting', 'the teen even run first april plan another one soon', 'run make feel happy i get call runner high run become lifestyle say', 'edgar also find call new healthy lifestyle', 'he start college southern illinois fall plan study exercise science', 'for mario watch little brother shed pound young age source pride', 'if would tell three year ago run i believe mario say', 'you see completely different person lot happy energy active', 'edgar agree', 'i even step door get mail say', 'people see dark sad side anymore', 'they see bright happy kid', 'for people look lose weight teenager follow advice don put', 'if say go run today tomorrow', 'don wait get bad say', 'you start put something serious happen something serious happen change life', 'visit edgar hernandez facebook page twitter runwithedgar follow journey']","“He would eat two really big burritos or sandwiches a day, packed with cheese, sour cream, a lot of bread, butter,” his older brother Mario said.The brothers, who live at home with their parents, have seen their weight loss inspire some changes for the whole family, Mario said.The family has cut down on eating out — once every couple of weeks, as opposed to four to five times a week.The teen even ran his first half-marathon in April, and he’s planning another one soon.He will start college at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville in the fall and plans to study exercise science."
18066,2,"The human nose is capable of discriminating at least one trillion different odors, according to a recent study The Nation reported.

Researchers from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute determined that human's sense of smell can recognize differences between complex odors mixed in the laboratory. For decades it was believed that humans could detect only 10,000 scents, putting the sense of smell well below the capabilities of sight and hearing, The Nation reported.

""Our analysis shows that the human capacity for discriminating smells is much larger than anyone anticipated,"" study co-author Leslie Vosshall, head of Rockefeller University's Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Behavior, said in a statement.

For the study, scientists subjected 26 participants to mixtures made with 128 different odorant ""molecules that individually might evoke grass, citrus or various chemicals, but were combined in groupings of up to 30,"" The Nation reported. Volunteers sampled three vials at a time - two that were the same and one that was different - to see if they could detect which was the outlier.

""We didn't want them to be explicitly recognizable, so most of our mixtures were pretty nasty and weird,"" Vosshall said. ""We wanted people to pay attention to 'here's this really complex thing - can I pick another complex thing as being different?'""

Volunteers were able to on average discern the difference between vials with up to 51 percent of the same components, with fewer volunteers detecting a difference once the mixtures shared more components.

From there, they extrapolated how many different scents the average person would be able to discriminate if they were presented with all the possible mixtures that could be made from their 128 odorants.

""It's like the way the census works: to count the number of people who live in the United States, you don't knock on every single door, you sample and then extrapolate,"" Vosshall said. ""That's how I like to think of this study. We knocked on a few doors.""

The previous estimate for the nose's capabilities dated to the 1920s and was not backed by any data, The Nation reported.

""Objectively, everybody should have known that that 10,000 number had to be wrong,"" Vosshall said.

She explained that it didn't make sense that humans should sense far fewer smells than colors. In the human eye, Vosshall explains, three light receptors work together to see up to 10 million colors. In contrast, the typical person's nose has 400 olfactory receptors.

""We know exactly the range of sound frequencies that people can hear, not because someone made it up, but because it was tested. We didn't just make up the fact that humans can't see infrared or ultraviolet light. Somebody took the time to test it,"" Vosshall said. ""For smell, nobody ever took the time to test.""

RICHMOND, Va. -- Owners of brands geared toward children of all ages are battling to keep notable names like Thin Mint, Tootsie Roll and Cinnamon Toast Crunch off the flavoured nicotine used in electronic cigarettes.

General Mills Inc., the Girl Scouts of the USA and Tootsie Roll Industries Inc. are among several companies that have sent cease-and-desist letters to makers of the liquid nicotine demanding they stop using the brands and may take further legal action if necessary. They want to make sure their brands aren't being used to sell an addictive drug or make it appealing to to children.

The actions highlight the debate about the array of flavours available for the battery-powered devices that heat a liquid nicotine solution, creating vapour that users inhale. The Food and Drug Administration last month proposed regulating electronic cigarettes but didn't immediately ban on fruit or candy flavours, which are barred for use in regular cigarettes because of the worry that the flavours are used to appeal to children.

It's growing pains for the industry that reached nearly $2 billion in sales last year in the face of looming regulation. E-cigarette users say the devices address both the addictive and behavioural aspects of smoking without the thousands of chemicals found in regular cigarettes.

There are about 1,500 e-liquid makers in the U.S. and countless others abroad selling vials of nicotine from traditional tobacco to cherry cola on the Internet and in retail stores, often featuring photos of the popular treats. Using the brand name like Thin Mint or Fireball conjures up a very specific flavour in buyers' minds, in a way that just ""mint chocolate"" or ""cinnamon"" doesn't.

""Using the Thin Mint name -- which is synonymous with Girl Scouts and everything we do to enrich the lives of girls -- to market e-cigarettes to youth is deceitful and shameless,"" Girl Scouts spokeswoman Kelly Parisi said in a statement.

The issue of illegally using well-known brands on e-cigarette products isn't new for some. For a couple of years, cigarette makers R.J. Reynolds Tobacco and Philip Morris USA have fought legal battles with websites selling e-cigarette liquid capitalizing on their Camel and Marlboro brand names and imagery. The companies have since released their own e-cigarettes but without using their top-selling brand names.

""It's the age-old problem with an emerging market,"" said Linc Williams, board member of the American E-liquid Manufacturing Standards Association and an executive at NicVape Inc., which produces liquid nicotine. ""As companies goes through their maturity process of going from being a wild entrepreneur to starting to establish real corporate ethics and product stewardship, it's something that we're going to continue to see.""

Williams said his company is renaming many of its liquids to names that won't be associated with well-known brands. Some companies demanded NicVape stop using brand names such as Junior Mints on their liquid nicotine. In other cases, the company is taking proactive steps to removing imagery and names like gummy bear that could be appealing to children.

""Unfortunately it's not going to change unless companies come in and assert their intellectual property,"" he said.

And that's what companies are starting to do more often as the industry has rocketed from thousands of users in 2006 to several million worldwide, bringing the issue to the forefront.

""We're family oriented. A lot of kids eat our products, we have many adults also, but our big concern is we have to protect the trademark,"" said Ellen Gordon, president and chief operating officer of Tootsie Roll Industries Inc. ""When you have well-known trademarks, one of your responsibilities is to protect (them) because it's been such a big investment over the years.""","The actions highlight the debate about the array of flavours available for the battery-powered devices that heat a liquid nicotine solution, creating vapour that users inhale.

Rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are zapping greens and legumes of their nutrients, according to a new study in the journal Nature.

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are currently approaching 400 parts per million (ppm), and are expected to jump to 550 ppm by 2050.

To see what would happen to some of the world's crops in a future, more CO2-dominant environment, a team of researchers used a system called Free Air Concentration Enrichment (FACE). It pumps out, monitors and adjusts ground-level atmospheric CO2 to simulate future conditions. Researchers grew 40 varieties of six different grains and legumes, including wheat, rice, field peas, soybeans, corn and sorghum, at seven locations throught Japan, Australia and the United States.

Predictably, the nutritional value of these crops, including zinc and iron levels, dropped when more CO2 filled the air.

Zinc and iron are important nutrients, and yet more than 2 billion people in the world are deficient in both. Consuming foods containing less of these nutrients can only exacerbate the problem.

""When we take all of the FACE experiments we've got around the world, we see that an awful lot of our key crops have lower concentrations of zinc and iron in them (at high CO2),"" Andrew Leakey, a University of Illinois botanist and genomic biology professor, said in a statement.

Zinc and iron went down significantly in wheat, rice, field peas and soybeans. Wheat and rice also saw notable declines in protein content at higher CO2.

""Across a diverse set of environments in a number of countries, we see this decrease in quality,"" Leakey added.

But sorghum and maize were not as affected, nutritionally speaking, at higher CO2 levels because these crops use a type of photosynthesis, called C4, which already concentrates carbon dioxide in their leaves, Leakey noted.","Rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are zapping greens and legumes of their nutrients, according to a new study in the journal Nature.

A Pennsylvania State University study suggests that although Americans feel stress at work and at home, people tend to be more aggravated in their places of residence.

In a “Today” show blog, Allison Linn says Penn State had 122 working adults self-report their stress levels at various intervals throughout the day, and they also took a swab test to measure their levels of cortisol, which is a major indicator of stress.

For a majority of the participants, cortisol levels were higher at home — instead of at work.

A Penn State professor and one of the reports’ authors, Sarah Damaske, said the participants’ self-reported levels of stress didn’t always match the results of their cortisone tests. In other words, people often lied or under-emphasized their stress levels during the study.

Damaske said a lot of the stress at home seemed to come from combining work and home responsibilities.

She said the findings don’t necessarily suggest that people should work more, or that they aren’t happy at home. Instead, she thinks it implies that the stress of trying to get everything done at home and at work tends to come out once people are home.

Damaske said the findings also helped researchers reach some other conclusions, such as work being healthy for people. Employment tend to have health benefits, compared to those who don’t work, Linn wrote.

“What we’re finding suggests that work is good for you — that there actually are benefits to working,” she said. The Penn State findings were consistent for men and women, and similar for parents and non-parents.

There was, however, one exception found in the study when it came to stress at home and on the job: Higher-income workers’ stress levels were about even in both locations. Damaske said that phenomenon wasn’t surprising, since previous research shows that people in higher-status jobs tend to experience more stress.","A Pennsylvania State University study suggests that although Americans feel stress at work and at home, people tend to be more aggravated in their places of residence.

31360,3,"In his opening statement, McElhinny asked jurors to remember where they were on Jan. 9, 2007, and he shared video of former Apple CEO Steve Jobs proudly unveiling the iPhone to cheering crowds that day in San Francisco.

""Samsung went far beyond competitive intelligence and crossed into the dark side of intentionally copying,"" McElhinny said.

Quinn countered that Apple is claiming overly broad rights to ideas.

""They don't own the only way to search on a phone; they don't own the only way to sync; they don't own the only way to unlock with a swipe,"" he said.

Consumers may end up paying the ultimate price in the case. Experts say the litigation could lead to more expensive smartphones and devices, and slow the overall pace of mobile innovation.

Rutgers Law School professor Michael A. Carrier said the litigation is ""a drain on employees' time and could lead to companies reinventing the wheel to try to steer clear of patents.""

Apple is accusing Samsung of infringing on five patents on newer devices, including Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Specifically, Apple claims Samsung stole a ""tap-from-search"" technology that allows someone searching for a telephone number or address on the web to tap on the results to call the number or put the address into a map. In addition, Apple says Samsung copied ""slide to unlock,"" which allows users to swipe the face of their smartphone to use it.

In a counterclaim, Samsung says Apple stole two of its ideas and used them for iPhones and iPads, including a wireless technology system that speeds up sending and receiving data.

Apple is demanding that Samsung pay an average of $33 for each of the 37 million Samsung devices running software allegedly conceived by Apple, and $40 per high-end device. The figure is well above other precedents, but Apple's legal team said it's fair compensation for the losses.

""I'll prove to you that is a gross, gross exaggeration, and an insult to your intelligence,"" Quinn told jurors.

Less than two years ago, a federal jury in the same courthouse found that Samsung was infringing on Apple patents. Samsung was ordered to pay about $900 million but is appealing and has been allowed to continue selling products using the technology.

Throughout three years of litigation, Samsung's global market share has grown. One of every three smartphones sold last year was a Samsung, now the market leader. Apple, with its typically higher priced iPhones, was second, with about 15 per cent of the market.

The jury was selected Monday from a pool of about 100 people, many of whom had opinions about the legal dispute centred in the Silicon Valley and work for companies affiliated with Samsung or Apple.

Two of the 10 jurors were excused Tuesday for health and financial reasons.

""I have eight of you left, and you are each precious,"" said Judge Lucy Koh, jokingly admonishing jurors to avoid bungee jumping and to eat health supplements.

27172,3,"Apple on Monday afternoon pushed out an update for its iOS mobile operating system, featuring support for the much-hyped CarPlay, improvements for Siri, Touch ID, and more.

First unveiled last week, CarPlay is described in the update notes as an ""iOS experience designed for the car."" It lets you control your phone, music, maps, messages, and third-party audio apps with Siri or your car's ""touch screen, knobs, and buttons.""

That is, if you have a CarPlay-enabled vehicle. The technology is making its debut in select cars shipping this year, including Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo. BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar, Land Rover, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Subaru, Suzuki, and Toyota customers will soon gain access as well, Apple said last week. For more, check out the slideshow below.

The first major update to iOS 7 also makes Siri a little more lifelike thanks to ""more natural sounding"" male and female voices for Mandarin Chinese, UK English, Australian English, and Japanese. You can also now manually control when the virtual personal assistant listens by holding down the home button while you speak and releasing it when you're done instead of just letting Siri automatically notice when you stop talking.

Meanwhile, iPhone 5s users should be happy to hear that Apple has improved Touch ID fingerprint recognition, though Cupertino did specify exactly how it is better. The company also fixed an issue that occasionally caused the home screen to crash.

In iTunes Radio, there's a new Search field above Featured Stations, letting you create stations based on songs and artists. You can also now buy albums right from the Now Playing screen, and subscribe to iTunes Match on your mobile device to listen to iTunes Radio without ads.

You'll also notice some changes to the calendar and camera. Country-specific holidays are now automatically added to the calendar for many countries, and you can now display events in month view. For mobile shutterbugs, there's a new setting to automatically enable HDR for the iPhone 5s.

On the accessibility front, the bold font option now includes the keyboard calculator and many icon glyphs. In addition, Apple has expanded the ""reduce motion"" option, which addresses iOS 7-related motion sickness, to cover weather, messages, and other animations.

The update requires at least 1.9GB of storage. Happy downloading, iOS users.

29110,3,"Apple looks set to reintroduce the iPad 4 on Tuesday as iPad 2 supplies begin to dry up. The tech giant will also reportedly launch a cheaper iPhone 5C with 8GB of storage. The news comes courtesy of 9to5Mac, which, according to its unnamed sources, says consignments of the iPad 4 have already been arriving at Apple stores across the country.

The expected move by the Cupertino company follows a forecast by a KGI Securities analyst last month who said the company’s fourth-generation iPad would replace the aging iPad 2 “in Q1 2014.”

The iPad 4, which launched in October 2012, was taken off the shelves with the October 2013 launch of the slimmer and lighter iPad Air, while Apple continued to sell the 16GB iPad 2 with a $400 price tag for the Wi-Fi-only version. The cellular model sells for $530.

Update on 03-18-2014 by Andy Boxall: The rumors were correct. Apple has replaced the old iPad 2 with the old iPad 4, which has been renamed the iPad Retina Display. It sits alongside the iPad Air and the iPad Mini Retina Display, and offers a slightly cheaper way for people to get the full-size iPad experience. There are two 16GB models available, with no option for more storage space. The 16GB Wi-Fi version costs $400, while adding cellular connectivity takes the price up to $530. This makes it identical to the iPad 2’s pricing, but for a higher spec machine.

The fourth edition of Apple’s tablet features the company’s high-resolution Retina display (no Retina on the iPad 2), a 5-megapixel camera (the iPad 2’s shooter is real lame), a more powerful processor (the A6X over the A5), and twice the RAM (1GB over 512MB). It also sports the smaller and newer Lightning dock connector instead of the iPad 2’s 30-pin connector.

With the impressive iPad Air costing only $100 more, and the same as the iPad Mini with Retina, consumers will have been wise to shun the iPad 2. The iPad 4 offers more, but really, the iPad Air is such a step up that waiting a little longer to save that extra $100 will be well worth the effort. Or just go with the $399 iPad Mini 2.

It was also suggested that Tuesday could see the launch of an 8GB iPhone 5C, and sure enough, a smaller, cheaper version of the 5C has shown up in the UK online Apple Store. It has yet to make an appearance in the U.S. store though.

We’ll be sure to keep you updated throughout the day with any further developments.

36880,3,"Game of drones: Why Google and Facebook are going head-to-head for control of the skies

Commercial flights are safely stowed six miles below along with the threat of any turbulence or convection; temperatures are stable, the sun is shining and everything is pretty much still.

battle two giant internet companies will be taking place, as both Google and Facebook invest in building high-altitude drones, capable of unmanned flight for years at a time.

There won't be any dogfights of course, but the commercial skirmishes have already begun, with Google announcing that they have acquired Titan Aerospace – a respected drone manufacturer that Facebook had previously been making overtures towards.

Google reportedly offered to beat any offer made by the social network, but Mark Zuckeberg’s team seems far from disconsolate: the social network announced this March that it had bought up a clutch of aerospace talent from Nasa as well as swallowing whole tiny Somerset-based firm Ascenta in order to power its own drone dreams.

Like Titan Aerospace, Ascenta are specialists in ‘high altitude long endurance vehicles’: a new breed of lightweight aircraft that can be sent 60,000 feet into the atmosphere, high above the clouds and storms that commercial flights have to contend with.

Both Facebook and Google have said that they’re interested in using these craft to supply internet access to remote areas of the world, and although there’s a straightforward commercial interest for both companies (more internet means more customers after all), quite how ground-breaking and useful the technology they're investing in is not yet fully understood.

Because they’re unmanned and remotely controlled, these aircraft are often thought of as drones, but really it makes more sense to think of them semi-permanent, atmospheric satellites. Unlike drones they’re not capable of nimble flight, of darting back and forth over a target; instead they’re more akin to massive, delicate gliders, taking off from regular airfields but then pretty much left to their own devices.

Although Titan Aerospace previously said it was not expecting to begin any commercial operations until 2015, it’s their aircraft that we’ve heard most about (far less is known about Ascenta), with their solar-powered Solara 50 and Solara 60 boasting wingspans greater than a Boeing 767 with solar-panels on the top of the craft keeping them aloft for five years at a time.

This gives them a mission range of more than 2.8 million miles and a field of view of more than 25,000 square miles. If you mounted a powerful enough base station on a Solara you could provide mobile coverage equal to that of hundreds of ground-based towers. Titan Aerospace previously said that they'd be able to deliver internet speeds of 1 gigabit per second - many times faster than average speeds in the US and UK.

However, mobile data isn’t the only thing that Facebook and Google’s new aircraft could provide. Like orbital satellites they can be rigged up with cameras and sensors to keep tabs on the Earth itself, with Google mentioning that the technology could be used to “monitor environmental damage like oil spills and deforestation”.

Although these claims might be little more than lip-service at the present time, projects like these would do a lot to deflect nascent criticism of companies' aerospace ambitions.

Facebook has previously been accused of disguising commercial interests as philanthropy after it launched its Internet.org initiative to lower the cost of internet access, and when Google announced Project Loon last year (a trial scheme to deliver the web via weather balloon) Bill Gates famously took the company to task over its priorities, saying ""when you’re dying of malaria, I suppose you’ll look up and see that balloon, and I’m not sure how it’ll help you.”

Although it seems unavoidable that both Google and Facebook will invest in technology that furthers their commercial ambitions, this doesn't mean that the technology won't be incredibly useful in the future. If one - or both - companies ends up with a fleet of drones delivering internet across the world, the need for public approval will mean that they're likely to use a portion of this power for scientific and humanitarian ends.

The technology is perhaps comparable with something like Google Street View: it's a wildly ambitious venture that has unsettling implications for privacy, but it also has the power to delight us - as well as provide a genuinely useful tool for businesses and consumers. Make no mistake: a cheaper alternative to orbital satellites would be a global good, even if the technology is being developed with the somewhat grubby goal of getting more punters on Facebook.

29072,3,"In a major discovery for understanding the origins of the universe, US scientists say they have detected echoes of the Big Bang 14 billion years ago.

The ""first direct evidence of cosmic inflation,"" or the rapid growth spurt that came in the first moments of the life of the universe, was found with the help of a telescope at the South Pole, and was announced by experts at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

The detection of these gravitational waves represents the last untested element of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, filling in a major gap in our understanding of how the universe was born.

The waves are ripples that move through space and time, and have been described as the ""first tremors of the Big Bang."" Their detection confirms an integral connection between quantum mechanics and general relativity.

""Detecting this signal is one of the most important goals in cosmology today. A lot of work by a lot of people has led up to this point,"" said John Kovac, leader of the BICEP2 collaboration at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

The telescope targeted a specific area of sky known as the ""Southern Hole"" outside the galaxy where there is little dust or extra galactic material to interfere with what humans could see with the potent sky-peering tool.

By observing the cosmic microwave background, or a faint glow left over from the Big Bang, small fluctuations gave scientists new clues about the conditions in the early universe.

The gravitational waves rippled through the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, and these images were captured by the telescope.

""The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,"" said Mr Kovac.

""It's one of the driest and clearest locations on Earth, perfect for observing the faint microwaves from the Big Bang.""

Rumours of the landmark discovery began to circulate Friday, as the hastily convened press conference was first announced.

However, scientists said they spent three years analyzing their data to rule out any errors.

""This has been like looking for a needle in a haystack, but instead we found a crowbar,"" said co-leader Clem Pryke of the University of Minnesota.

Harvard theorist Avi Loeb said the findings provide ""new insights into some of our most basic questions: Why do we exist? How did the universe begin?

""These results are not only a smoking gun for inflation, they also tell us when inflation took place and how powerful the process was,"" Loeb said.

According to theoretical physicist Alan Guth, who proposed the idea of inflation in 1980, described the latest study as ""definitely worthy of a Nobel Prize.""

""This is a totally new, independent piece of cosmological evidence that the inflationary picture fits together,"" Mr Guth, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was quoted as telling the journal Nature.","In a major discovery for understanding the origins of the universe, US scientists say they have detected echoes of the Big Bang 14 billion years ago.

30862,3,"Cosmos is a hit, again. Neil DeGrasse Tyson is a pop science star. Thanks to him, kids dream about expanding human knowledge of the phenomenal universe. Now: Where's a liberal arts rockstar to make people care about human culture that much?

Tyson makes the sciences so damned vital. After a career of ""space evangelism,"" advocating for a bigger NASA budget to focus the dreams of would-be scientists, he's used Cosmos—a reboot of the wildly successful Carl Sagan series—to enliven the natural world and slay a few superstitious shibboleths along the way. Chances are you watched him explain the Big Bang and Einsteinian relativity last night. Before that, he reclaimed evolution from its modern-day discontents.

It works. There's actually a documented ""Neil DeGrasse Tyson Effect"" on listeners. And he's not just hooking in kids. ""The challenge has never been children,"" he's told The Atlantic of his science-communication goals:

The challenge has been adults... All the adults are saying, ""We need to improve science in the world. Let's train the kids."" I've never heard an adult say, ""We need more science in the world. Train me."" I've never heard an adult say that. It's the adults that need the science literacy, the kind of literacy that can transform the nation practically overnight.

Yet it's not just science literacy that's wanting among American adults today. The liberal arts have basically been buried in the landfill of our culture under McDonald's wrappers and bank statements and William Hung CDs. Our consumption- and production-obsessed political leadership thinks these humanities disciplines should be defunded because, hey, who employs theorists these days?

""Is it a vital interest of the state to have more anthropologists?"" Florida GOP Governor Rick Scott said in 2011—who went ahead and answered his own rhetorical question, ""I don't think so,"" because he probably never covered rhetorical reasoning in business school.

This is nothing new: The history of America is in some sense a long obsession with the practicalities of life and an equally long disdain for the theoretical. In universities, undergrad programs have shifted from life education to job training. The two aren't mutually exclusive, of course, but most advocates of ""practical"" degrees see theory as a threat to practicality somehow.

The humanities breed curiosity. A certain epistemological humility. And as a result, empathy. Language matters. Stories matter. Art matters. History matters.

This is your brain without a grounding in the humane arts and letters:

The National Endowment for the Humanities is more endangered than NASA. Funding for humanities research amounts to about 1/200th of the federal funding dedicated to scientific and engineering scholarship.

Yet science has Tyson, whose show airs on the same channel as American Idol. More than that, it has Bill Nye and Brian Greene, all of whom stand on the shoulders of Sagan and Richard Feynman. The pure and applied sciences have always had champions who can stir up national pride and, in so doing, strengthen our civic education and bolster our economy.

The humanities, they don't even have Sister Wendy anymore. Ken Burns made superstars out of some historians, trained and amateur, back in the '90s. But Shelby Foote is dead now.

Imagine if a philosopher or historian or literature professor could show mass-TV audiences the inner workings of things that are not science—from the assumptions of economics to the greatness of the great books to the sociocultural complications of canon-building to the cultural coding of Duck Dynasty. Imagine if they factchecked movies like Spiderman and Gravity for ethical and intellectual lapses with the geeky gusto that Tyson displays in factchecking the films' scientific content. Imagine if we live-tweeted these professors' lively, decidedly untraditional lectures and Q&As and documentaries the way we did with Tyson's.

Imagine if, owing to these liberal arts communicators, people dreamed about discovering the next great writing style, or using principles of art history to illuminate modern advertising, or building a neo-Kantian theory of relations between states, or uncovering new archival evidence of America's history, warts and all.

Who are those superstars? Where are they? And without them, where are we?

Update: Fellow FSU PhD Kelly Baker, a religion scholar, argues similarly on the Chronicle of Higher Education's Vitae blog. Her article includes some great prescriptive advice to academics in the liberal arts on how to better articulate their work to mass audiences, a la NDT—a great rejoinder to many of the humanities scholars' comments on this post below. Baker writes:

But, Kelly, what if my research is complicated?, you might ask. The world is a complicated place, but complexity is not the end point of discussion. It's just the beginning. Slow down and show people how complicated, messy, intersectional, and entangled our worlds are. Walk them through your subject in a way they can understand. Bring your message to them.

It's a great read. Give it a look.

30770,3,"Google loves to unveil a good gag product on April Fool's Day. Remember 8-bit maps? YouTube DVDs?

But despite arriving on April 1, 2004, its webmail service was no joke. Google's simple, browser-based inbox helped seed several ideas that have become so commonplace over the intervening decade, they practically define modern computing as we know it.

Gmail debuted as an invitation-only product, forcing us to beg friends with newly minted gmail.com addresses for precious invites. And once we were in, we experienced something miraculous – a spam-free inbox with a killer integrated search tool and a gigabyte of gratis storage.

We already had webmail, but it was viewed mostly as a convenience to be used while on the road since we could access it from any computer. It wasn't enjoyable. Web inboxes were slow and cumbersome, messy with checkboxes and radio buttons, and often so riddled with spam they had to be emptied frequently lest they reach capacity.

Gmail changed all that. It was fast and elegant. There was so much storage, you never had to delete anything. In fact, you couldn't. There wasn't even a Delete button! And you didn't miss the Delete button, because the inbox was almost entirely spam-free.

What's more, it was built using Ajax, a JavaScript hack that lets webpages update without reloading and that doesn't require any plug-ins. Ajax had been kicking around on the web's bleeding edge for a couple of years. Microsoft had begun using it to dynamically display stock quotes inside Internet Explorer. But most websites still lacked any sort of dynamic interactivity. Before Ajax, users would click a link or a button on a webpage, and then they'd have to wait for the entire page to reload in order to see the result. Using Ajax, web programmers could build an application that redrew pieces of the page on the fly without having to reload the whole thing. A user could see new elements appearing and disappearing on the page as they clicked, minus all the waiting.

Gmail took Ajax mainstream. It gave webmail a slick snappiness more akin to a desktop application, and it left clunky old Hotmail in the dust. New messages just appeared, chat windows popped up instantly — all without a browser refresh. Today, we all expect websites to behave like real applications.

Another concept made familiar by Gmail: trading privacy for services. Skeptics objected to Google machine-reading our emails to improve its ad-targeting science, but the rest of us didn't care. After all, Gmail did so much, and it didn't cost a dime.

When the service finally went no-invites-required in February 2007 and opened to everyone, its user base quickly ballooned to tens of millions. Today, it's around half a billion. The service has also grown into a full-fledged platform. There's a contact manager and fully integrated text, video and SMS chat. Users can plug in widgets that help manage tasks, set reminders or just show pictures of their kids. Google has built up an entire suite of office applications that run in the browser, and Gmail is the hub.

And that brings us to the final big idea that Gmail popularized: cloud-based services.

Yes, cloud computing has always been a thing. The idea of storing data on a server and accessing it over the internet is older than your first SCSI drive, and it wasn't until recently that it acquired a fancy new buzzword. But Gmail put all the key concepts of cloud computing — a service delivered over the network, flexible mass storage, instant access from anywhere — into a consumer product that ran inside the web browser and behaved like a regular computer program. The idea that you could run Gmail at your desk at work, then go home and launch it on your desktop using a different browser, even a different operating system, and have it look and behave exactly the same way in both places was a totally new concept to almost everyone who used it. No special software was required. You never had to worry about storage. It was always there. And there were no messy connections, just a simple password login.

Today, all of these concepts — web applications, machine-targeted ads, cloud storage — are commonplace. Gmail was the arbiter. It may have not have exactly lowered the heavens upon its arrival, but it certainly ushered in the web's common era.

In this episode of CNET Update, learn more about Amazon Dash, a new Wi-Fi wand being tested for Amazon Fresh subscribers. The Dash scans grocery barcodes to add the item to your online shopping cart. the idea is that you would scan items in the kitchen when it's time to restock. The Dash also has a microphone to add items verbally. The Amazon Fresh service costs $300 a year and is only available to some residents in Seattle and parts of California.

Scanning barcodes to build a shopping list is not a new concept. Dozens of apps let you run around the house scanning items with a smartphone camera. Grocery iQ is popular and run by Coupons.com. There are apps to help you build a shopping list to share with other family members, like OurGroceries. (I personally use Couple, which has other fun perks besides sharing lists.) There's also ShopWell, which scans barcodes and tells you if there are healthier options to consider.

And Google Glass is back in the news with a new Livestream app. The headgear always made it easy to take hands-free photos and videos, but the app takes it up a notch with live video broadcasting online. But that video broadcast won't last too long, unless the Glass is hooked up to a backup battery.

27659,3,"Congress's investigation of a deadly defect in some General Motors cars widened on Tuesday, and a House committee led by Republican Fred Upton ordered the automaker and a federal regulator to provide details on steps they took to get unsafe cars off the road.

In another development, federal prosecutors in New York are examining whether GM is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose the defect, according to a source familiar with that investigation.

The malfunction, which first came to light a decade ago and involves more than 1.6 million GM vehicles, has been linked to 13 deaths and prompted a recent recall by the automaker. The defect, a problem with the ignition switch in some GM cars, could cause cars to stall, airbags to fail and other problems while moving at high speeds.

The supplier of the ignition switch, Delphi Automotive Plc , said in a statement on Tuesday that the part had not been provided to any other automaker.

The congressional inquiry expanded to the Senate as Commerce Committee Chairman John Rockefeller moved to launch hearings about the issue.

In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters to GM CEO Mary Barra and National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration Acting Administrator David Friedman seeking information on their responses to consumers' complaints about the problem. They set a deadline of March 25 for the information.

Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, said there were several questions surrounding the suspected malfunctioning ignition switches in the GM cars.

""We are just looking for answers to determine what the company and NHTSA knew about these problems, when they knew it, and what they did about it,"" Upton said.

The senior Democrat on the panel, Representative Henry Waxman, said the committee will look at whether GM ""knowingly allowed faulty and dangerous cars to remain on the road."" Waxman added that lawmakers also will gauge whether NHTSA ""has all the tools the agency needs to keep drivers safe.""

Congress' investigation into automobile safety issues is the latest in a string of high-profile problems plaguing the industry. In 2009-11, Toyota recalled automobiles in the United States after consumers complained about uncontrolled acceleration.

In 2000, Upton spearheaded an investigation into Firestone tire failures on Ford Motor Co vehicles, which resulted in federal legislation requiring better industry reporting on consumer complaints about defects.

Neither the House nor Senate panels has yet announced when hearings would be held or who would be called to testify.

White House spokesman Jay Carney sidestepped a question at a daily briefing about whether the White House was satisfied with how the NHTSA has handled the GM matter.

""Well, I can tell you that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a formal investigation into whether GM shared the information they had about this issue as quickly as they should have,"" Carney said.

He referred further questions about the recall to the agency.

Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the watchdog group the Center for Auto Safety, said NHTSA had more than enough data about the defect to order a recall by early 2007.

""It's absolutely egregious,"" he said.

""NHTSA has become too cozy with the auto industry,"" Ditlow said.

GM spokesman Greg Martin noted that the company on Monday said that it will cooperate with Congress as it looks into how GM and the federal government responded to the safety problem.

GM officials no doubt will be called to testify in any House or Senate hearings in coming weeks.

But the company is no stranger to Capitol Hill where it has a strong lobbying presence.

Last year, GM spent $8.8 million on lobbying activities, earning it a ranking of 42nd out of 2,900 organizations tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics. The expenditures were double those of rival Toyota for that year, according to Senate lobbying records.","The defect, a problem with the ignition switch in some GM cars, could cause cars to stall, airbags to fail and other problems while moving at high speeds.

35669,3,"An unusual “Tweet-up” — a meeting of people who know each other on Twitter — involving an ambassador, an astronaut and a prime minister has taken place on a video-link between Japan and the International Space Station.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and US ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy chatted with the Japanese commander of the ISS, Koichi Wakata, as he circled the Earth hundreds of miles up.

The three, who are all active on the micro-blogging site, talked on Thursday evening about daily life aboard the station, while Kennedy and Wakata traded compliments on their activities in the blogosphere.

“It’s an honour to be able to speak with you,” Kennedy, the only surviving daughter of assassinated US president John F. Kennedy said.

“Congratulations Commander Wakata on being the first Japanese commander of the space station and I am glad that we follow each other on Twitter,” Kennedy said.

“Ambassador Kennedy, it’s quite an honour that you follow my tweets,” Wakata replied.

Wakata who was flanked by fellow space-farers from Russia and the US, battled with zero-gravity to grab the microphone and make himself heard back on Earth as Abe addressed him.

“You are the first Asian to become commander of the ISS,” the Japanese PM said. “Are there days when you think that it is hard work?”

Wakata, a practised diplomat as well as an astronaut said the multi-national crew was an effective unit.

“I think we really work well as a team,” he said. “But we are more than just crew mates, qualities from all the countries we represent complete each other and we can communicate perfectly,” he added.

The conversation took place hours after a a Russian cargo ship docked with the ISS, bringing the crew crucial supplies and water.

Earlier this month NASA announced that it was cutting space cooperation with Russia — except over the ISS — because of Moscow’s actions in Ukraine, including the takeover of Crimea last month.

35918,3,"After a month of ""Titanfall"" being out in the wild, developer Respawn Entertainment has just unveiled the game’s first official map pack. Due out this May, ""Titanfall: Expedition"" will allow players to experience the robot-infused first-person shooter in three new arenas.

The cover image of ""Expedition"" showcases the ""Swampland"" map, which is a green, marshy area filled with ancient alien artifacts. At its PAX East 2014 Panel, Respawn noted that this tree-heavy map will give on-foot pilots plenty of opportunities to get the jump on the game’s lumbering Titans.

""Expedition"" will also feature a water-based map called ""Runoff,"" as well as a third arena called ""War Games"" set in a pilot training area. The new maps are set after the multiplayer game’s campaign, which will be reflected in each level’s details and mid-match dialogue.

""Expedition"" marks the first official paid DLC pack for ""Titanfall,"" which was recently updated with private matches and party system improvements. According to Respawn, this new content is only the beginning.

""Titanfall"" is due to get a series of free updates throughout the year, including a new 2 vs. 2 version of the Last Titan Standing gameplay mode, which starts off all players in a Titan with limited lives.

Respawn will also deliver new Titan-focused Burn Cards, which are one-time use power-ups that enhance abilities like damage and movement.



The folks behind ""Titanfall"" want to make the game a more social experience than ever, with an upcoming “hashtag” feature due later in the year. This will allow you to find like-minded players to enter matches with, using Twitter-style hashtags like #CasualGamers or #HardcorePilots.

Respawn recognizes that many ""Titanfall"" players take the game seriously, and the developer is looking into partnerships with eSports groups, like Major League Gaming, for those who want to play it on a professional level.

While ""Expedition"" and future map packs will be paid, Respawn noted that game modes and extra features will always be released for free.

""This is a living, breathing world,"" said Respawn producer Drew McCoy at the panel. ""We want the game to continue to get better for [fans] whether or not they spend a dime.""

If you’re ready to drop your Titan in some new territory, you can pick up ""Expedition"" this May for the Xbox One, Xbox 360 and PC version of the game. Respawn has yet to announce pricing.

San Jose, California: Samsung fired back at Apple's accusations of patent theft Tuesday, saying the South Korean tech giant didn't write any of the Android software on its smartphones and tablets, Google did.

""Not one of the accused features on this phone was designed, much less copied, by anyone at Samsung,"" Samsung attorney Peter Quinn said. ""The accused features on this phone were developed independently by some of the software engineers at Google, up the road in Mountain View.""

The finger-pointing took place in US District Court in San Jose, where Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. are accusing each other of stealing ideas from each other. At stake: more than $2 billion if Samsung loses, about $6 million if Apple loses.

On opening day, Google Inc. — which is not named in the litigation — was clearly a large part of it.

The trial marks the latest round in a long-running, worldwide series of lawsuits between Apple and Samsung over mobile devices.

Quinn told jurors that Apple's gripe is with Android, a Google-developed smartphone operating system that now makes up about 70 percent of the global market.

Apple's lawyer Harold McElhinny had anticipated the tactic.

""Don't be misled by that,"" he said in his opening statement. ""This case is not about Google. It is Samsung that has made the decision to copy these features, it is Samsung, not Google, that chooses to put these features into their phones, and it is Samsung that has made the decision to keep on infringing on Apple's patents.""

Google declined to comment on the controversy.

The trial's first witness, Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said the relationship between the companies has soured since Samsung launched the Galaxy smartphone.

""It appeared that Samsung was going to be doing a lot of copying of our product. It looked like an attempt to copy the iPhone,"" he said.

Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who died in 2011, was widely invoked throughout opening day.

Apple's McElhinny asked jurors to remember where they were on Jan. 9, 2007, and he shared video of Jobs proudly unveiling the iPhone to cheering crowds that day in San Francisco.

""Samsung went far beyond competitive intelligence and crossed into the dark side of intentionally copying,"" McElhinny said.

Quinn countered that Apple is claiming overly broad rights to ideas.

""They don't own the only way to search on a phone, they don't own the only way to sync, they don't own the only way to unlock with a swipe,"" he said.

Consumers may end up paying the ultimate price in the case. Experts say the litigation could lead to more expensive smartphones and devices, and slow the overall pace of mobile innovation.

Rutgers Law School professor Michael A. Carrier said the litigation is ""a drain on employees' time and could lead to companies reinventing the wheel to try to steer clear of patents.""

Apple accuses Samsung of infringing on five patents on newer devices, including Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Specifically, Apple claims Samsung stole a ""tap-from-search"" technology that allows someone searching for a telephone number or address on the Web to tap on the results to call the number or put the address into a map. In addition, Apple says Samsung copied ""slide to unlock,"" which allows users to swipe the face of their smartphone to use it.

In a counterclaim, Samsung says Apple stole two of its ideas and used them for iPhones and iPads, including a wireless technology system that speeds up sending and receiving video.

Apple is demanding that Samsung pay an average of $33 for each of the 37 million Samsung devices running software allegedly conceived by Apple, and $40 per high-end device. The figure is well above other precedents, but Apple's legal team said it's fair compensation for the losses.

""I'll prove to you that is a gross, gross exaggeration, and an insult to your intelligence,"" Quinn told jurors.

Less than two years ago, a federal jury in the same courthouse found that Samsung was infringing on Apple patents. Samsung was ordered to pay about $900 million but is appealing and has been allowed to continue selling products using the technology.

Throughout three years of litigation, Samsung's global market share has grown. One of every three smartphones sold last year was a Samsung, now the market leader. Apple, with its typically higher priced iPhones, was second, with about 15 percent of the market.

The jury was selected Monday from a pool of about 100 people, many of whom had opinions about the legal dispute centered in the Silicon Valley and work for companies affiliated with Samsung or Apple.

Two of the 10 jurors were excused Tuesday for health and financial reasons.

""I have eight of you left, and you are each precious,"" said Judge Lucy Koh, jokingly admonishing jurors to avoid bungee jumping and to eat health supplements.

36453,3,"Skywatcher and photographer David Paleino snapped this view of the total lunar eclipse of June 15, 2011 from Italy using a Fujifilm FinePix S2000HD camera.

Since the dawn of time, people have linked astronomical phenomena to events that occur on Earth.

From ancient comets that allegedly foretold of natural disasters to a 2011 ""supermoon"" that was suspected (at least by one astrologer) of causing storms and volcanoes that never quite appeared, we humans are a superstitious lot when it comes to celestial happenings.

Now, a popular televangelist from San Antonio named John Hagee has stated that the four lunar eclipses scheduled to begin this month — also known as ""blood moons"" — are a sign that biblical prophecies are about to come true, as detailed in his book, ""Four Blood Moons: Something Is About to Change"" (Worthy Publishing, 2013). [10 Failed Doomsday Predictions]

The lunar eclipse that will occur early tomorrow (April 15) is the first of four consecutive eclipses that Hagee claims are a ""world-shaking event,"" according to the New York Daily News.

Astronomers refer to a series of eclipses such as this as a tetrad. While a tetrad isn't a common occurrence, they have happened in the recent past. The last such series happened in 2003 and 2004, and seven more will occur this century.

But the fact that tetrads and lunar eclipses are natural occurrences doesn't faze Hagee, who has pronounced it significant that each blood moon is happening on a significant religious holiday.

The April 15 eclipse will happen during Passover, the Jewish holiday commemorating the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. Subsequent blood moons will occur during the Feast of the Tabernacles later this year, Passover in 2015, and the Feast of the Tabernacles in 2015.

""Just as in biblical times, God is controlling the sun, the moon and the stars to send our generation a signal that something big is about to happen. The question is: Are we watching and listening to His message?"" Hagee writes in his book, as quoted in the Daily News.

Hagee is far from the first to make a tenuous link between natural events and biblical prophesies or religious myths. When comet Hale-Bopp appeared in 1997, rumors surfaced that an alien spacecraft was following the comet — covered up, of course, by NASA and the astronomical community.

Though the claim was refuted by astronomers, the rumors were publicized on Art Bell's paranormal radio talk show ""Coast to Coast AM."" These claims inspired a San Diego cult named Heaven's Gate to conclude that the world would end soon. The world did indeed end for 39 of the cult members, who committed suicide on March 26, 1997.

The end of the world was also scheduled for Dec. 21, 2012, according to the so-called Mayan prophecy, a misinterpretation of a calendar used by the ancient Maya people of Mesoamerica. Though the Maya made no such predictions, some modern individuals and groups claimed the civilization had foretold the end of days would begin on that date. It never, of course, happened.

Though Hagee's message about the tetrad of blood moons may seem like nothing more than one more pseudo-religious fantasy, he's no stranger to such controversies. In 2008, Hagee was criticized for blaming Hurricane Katrina on a New Orleans gay and lesbian rally.

""There was to be a homosexual parade there on the Monday that the Katrina came. And the promise of that parade was that it was going to reach a level of sexuality never demonstrated before in any of the other Gay Pride parades,"" Hagee said on NPR. ""And I believe that the Hurricane Katrina was, in fact, the judgment of God against the city of New Orleans.""

But the fact that tetrads and lunar eclipses are natural occurrences doesn't faze Hagee, who has pronounced it significant that each blood moon is happening on a significant religious holiday.
Subsequent blood moons will occur during the Feast of the Tabernacles later this year, Passover in 2015, and the Feast of the Tabernacles in 2015.

28673,3,"Paris has resorted to drastic measures to curb soaring pollution levels by forcing all cars with number plates ending in even numbers off the road for the first time in two decades.

Around 700 police officers were deployed on Monday to man 60 checkpoints around the French capital to ensure that only cars with number plates ending in odd numbers were out on the streets.

The government made the announcement on Saturday after pollution particulates in the air exceeded safe levels for five straight days in Paris and its environs.

Electric and hybrid cars will be exempted from the ban as well as any vehicle carrying three people or more.

The restrictions came into force across Paris and 22 surrounding areas from 5:30am local Paris time (04:30 GMT) on Monday.

They will be reviewed on a daily basis, with odd numbers potentially banned on Tuesday if an extension is deemed necessary.

Public transport has been free since the weekend to persuade Parisians to leave their cars at home, and the state railway company SNCF warned on its website of packed suburban trains at peak hours due to the extreme measure.

""It is sure we will have more clients today,"" a delighted taxi driver told the AFP news agency.

Those who choose to brave the ban risk a fine of $30 if paid immediately, or $48 if paid within three days.

'Hasty ban'

It is the first time since 1997 that the French authorities have resorted to such a drastic measure.

Opposition UMP candidate for Paris mayor, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, called the measure a ""fig leaf"".

Ecology Minister Philippe Martin said he understood the ""difficulties, the irritation and even anger"" over the move, adding: ""But we just had to take this decision.""

France's Automobile Club Association (ACA), which counts about 760,000 members, denounced the move as ""hasty, ineffective"" and ""bound to lead to chaos"".

""This measure had no effect in any country where it was introduced,"" said ACA head Didier Bollecker.

""Drivers are being targeted even though heating is more polluting, but no one is asking for heating to be used on alternate days,"" Bollecker said.

By Saturday the number of pollution particulates in the air had fallen slightly after hitting a high of 180 micrograms per cubic metre - well over double the safe limit - on Friday.

So-called PM10 particulates are created by vehicles, heating and heavy industry, with the safe limit set at 80 per cubic metre.

Pollution particulates in the air can cause asthma attacks as well as respiratory and heart problems.","Paris has resorted to drastic measures to curb soaring pollution levels by forcing all cars with number plates ending in even numbers off the road for the first time in two decades.

36419,3,"In its newest attempt to take over, and make over, the look of wireless service, T-Mobile unveiled its latest ploy to attract customers: no more overage charges to consumer plans.

Starting in May the company is axing all overage fees, including domestic talk, text and data, for all consumer plans. The new policy will begin showing up with consumers’ June bills.

The new no-overage practice means that consumers won’t automatically be on the hook to pay for any usage they incur beyond their plans’ limits. Instead, consumers will have the option to pay for more access through day- or week-long data passes or no use their devices.

A similar format is being used in the newly launched Simple Start plan which offers consumers unlimited talk/text and 500 MB of data. When a customer reaches their limit they can purchase more data or simply not use their device until the beginning of the next billing cycle.

T-Mobile estimates that U.S. consumers pay more than $1 billion a year in “greedy, predatory” overage charges to wireless providers. That’s why officials with the company publicly called out fellow wireless providers to end the charges, even starting the “#AbolishOverages” hashtag.

“Today I’m laying down a challenge to AT&T, Verizon and Sprint to join T-Mobile in ending these outrageous overage penalties for all consumers – because it’s the right thing to do,” John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile, says in a news release. “Overage fees are flat out wrong. Agree with me? Join me in putting this challenge to all the major national carriers by signing my petition on Change.org. Right here. Take one minute to be a part of this consumer movement.”

The liberation from overage charges is the carrier’s latest attempt to separate itself from other national carriers. Last year, the company did away with annual service contracts and launched the early upgrade program JUMP.

“The worst thing about these overage fees is that they’re often inflicted on those who can least afford them,” added Legere.

The company’s customer friendly stance doesn’t seem to translate to their own employees. Earlier this month, the company ended its employee and college student discounts. However, following public outcry the carrier restored the discount to current customers, but new customers won’t be eligible.

32467,3,"Image copyright Microsoft Image caption As the hours tick away Microsoft has been encouraging people to ditch Windows XP

Support for the venerable Windows XP operating system ends this Tuesday.

It means that there will be no more official security updates and bug fixes for the operating system from Microsoft.

Some governments have negotiated extended support contracts for the OS in a bid to keep users protected.

Security firms said anyone else using the 13-year-old software would be at increased risk of infection and compromise by cyber-thieves.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Robert Schifreen tells 5 live: ""Microsoft's not doing the work for you""

Old code

Statistics suggest 20-25% of all users have stuck with XP despite the fact that there have been three major releases of Windows since its debut in 2001.

Some of those existing XP users have struck deals to get security fixes from Microsoft while they complete their migration away from the ageing code.

The UK government has signed a £5.5m deal for extended support. Similarly the Dutch government has signed a ""multi-million euro"" deal to obtain help for the 40,000 PCs running XP used by the nation's civil servants.

Anyone currently running Windows XP already faced a disproportionate risk of falling victim to malware, said David Emm, a senior research analyst at security firm Kaspersky.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many of the world's cash machines are still believed to be running Windows XP

""Our data indicates that less than one fifth of our customers run Windows XP but more than a quarter of infections are Windows XP-based,"" he said.

That exposure ratio was only going to get worse after 8 April, he said, once the last security patch for Windows XP had been released.

That final patch will fix a series of bugs, one of which is rated as critical and is already being actively exploited despite only being discovered in late March.

""Effectively, every vulnerability discovered after 8 April will become a zero-day vulnerability - that is, one for which there is not and never will be, a patch,"" said Mr Emm.

Windows XP users topped the list of victims cyber-thieves targeted, said Maik Morgenstern and Andreas Marx from the German AV-Test group, which rates and ranks security software.

""Malware writers go for the low hanging fruits because it's a lot easier to infect systems running on an old Windows XP operating system compared to brand-new Windows 8.1, with all its built-in security features,"" they said.

""We think we will see a lot of attacks for Windows XP within the next few months, but attackers will also always add exploits for other Windows systems just to catch those systems as well.""

Patch plan

Image copyright Microsoft Image caption Many have stuck with XP and ignored newer versions of Windows

Orla Cox, a senior manager at cyber-defence firm Symantec's security response unit, said criminals groups were likely to hoard the XP vulnerabilities they knew about rather than use them to bolster malware being spammed out to millions of people.

""The types of groups sitting on zero-days will tend to use them against high-end targets and for corporate espionage,"" she said. ""Some organisations will have particular concerns because they find it so hard to move away from XP.""

However, she added, any zero-day that did get used against a corporate target was likely to be re-used later on.

""Once it's out there it gets into the malware kits and then gets circulated and there will be no defence,"" she said.

Mark O'Neill, a spokesman for data management firm Axway, said organisations were getting better at coping with software that had hit its end-of-life.

""Beyond high-profile programs like XP there are a lot of products that have gone out of support because the company behind them has gone out of business or was acquired,"" he said.

In addition many other products were written in old programming languages that made them expensive to maintain and update.

As a result, many IT departments have put such ageing programs in the virtual equivalent of a ""black box"" and subsequently update the external code if security patches need to be applied.

""You can create a layer above the older application and that gives you a place to patch,"" Mr O'Neill said.

""Companies are not defenceless even with the things they cannot patch.""","Image copyright Microsoft Image caption As the hours tick away Microsoft has been encouraging people to ditch Windows XPSupport for the venerable Windows XP operating system ends this Tuesday.

Expedition, slated for a May release, will add new battlegrounds to the multiplayer shooter.The Expedition Pack includes three new maps. ""Swampland"" is set in a marsh filled with alien ruins. Players can wall-run along the trees above. ""Runoff"" is set in a similar environment that Respawn says will feature plenty of water and pipes. War Games is based on the training simulator where Pilots learn the ropes.These maps will continue the storyline of the maincampaign. Respawn didn't provide many details on the plot. I'm going to gaze into my crystal ball here and guess that the story centers around six Pilots from the Militia fighting six Pilots from the IMC, though.Expedition is one of the three premium DLC packs planned for the game. Each will cost $10 to download. Players can also spring for the $24.99 Season Pass to get all three at a discount.Respawn also has free content in the works, though. During the PAX East panel, they reiterated that they're going to release new game modes for no additional charge . They may also release temporary modes called ""rifts or variants"" that put a twist on existing match types. These rifts/variants would then be available for a week or so. If they're well-received by players, they could become permanent additions to the game. In other words, they're like the feature modes for League of Legends or the Lab from the Uncharted series 's free DLC will also include new features based on player feedback. Players will be able to customize their Titans with decals to give them some individuality. In a nod to YouTubers, Respawn will also give players the ability to hide the game's HUD while recording video. The developers also plan to add daily challenges and rankings to give competitive players something to strive for. Players will even be able to join each others' games using hashtags.Finally, Respawn plans to add more burn cards. I'm surprised they didn't mention new weapons or abilities but I guess burn cards are the easiest to add to the mix.

33442,3,"The Google Glass is finally arriving in the U.S. market for $1500, but only for a day.

Google sure knows how to spur demand in the consumer market. The Internet giant is offering a one-time chance for anyone, literally anyone in the U.S., to grab Google's high-tech eyewear by paying $1500 plus tax on April 15. For the first time, the Google Glass will be available in the commercial market without the need for an invitation from Google to join the Explorer program. This is the biggest push yet to get the Glass in as many hands (heads?) as possible. The news, which was supposedly scheduled to be out next week, was confirmed in a Google+ post from Google Glass official account, Thursday.

So for those who have been wanting the Glass desperately, here is your one good chance. Google initially started taking pre-orders for its eyewear two years ago at Google I/O 2012, which shipped out the Glass to the first batch of 2,000 Explorers. Later that year, the web giant started offering consumers a chance to buy the pricey eyewear by letting Google know what they would do with Glass via #ifihadglass, which got 8,000 people with their own pair. Other smaller promotions, like friend referrals and official waitlist to become an Explorer, were started last year, but the latest promotion is probably the last major effort to give its developers a heads up before the official launch later this year.

""Our Explorers are moms, bakers, surgeons, rockers, and each new Explorer has brought a new perspective that is making Glass better,"" Google said in a g+ post, Thursday. ""But every day we get requests from those of you who haven't found a way into the program yet, and we want your feedback too. So in typical Explorer Program fashion, we're trying something new.""

Under the new promotion, interested buyers for the Glass need to mark their calendars to make a purchase, or sign up on Google's official page to get an alert on the big day. The offer starts April 15, 9 a.m. EDT. Google Glass buyers will also get a free sunglass shade or prescription lens frame.","The Google Glass is finally arriving in the U.S. market for $1500, but only for a day.

The Chromecast family is rapidly growing now that Google released an SDK to outside developers. Chromecast welcomed Crackle, Rdio, Vudu and PlayOn to its list of compatible applications for content streaming from your mobile device to your TV.

Ever since Google introduced Chromecast, developers have been vying to get onto the popular new content-streaming platform. The SDK helped speed up the process and now Chromecast has dozens of partners and a lot more users. Each of the four new apps Google added to Chromecast on Monday bring something new to the table.

Vudu is available as an app for mobile devices, computers and Smart TVs. It contains a collection of movies and TV shows, which users of the app can rent or buy and then stream on their devices. The Android app for Vudu already supports Chromecast streaming and new reports indicate that the iOS app either has the ability to connect to Chromecast, or will very soon.

Crackle is actually Sony's video streaming app, which lets users stream TV shows and movies for free. The videos have advertisements, but then again so does TV, so all in all, it's still a good app. Both the Android and iOS Crackle apps now work with Chromecast, too. Crackle is also available on Roku's media-streaming dongle, so Chromecast can't claim exclusivity in this case.

Rdio, one of the most popular subscription music-streaming apps is also compatible with Chromecast now. Rdio costs $10 a month, but it will give you access to millions of songs. Rdio has apps for iOS, Android, Windows and Chrome, so no matter where your music is, you'll be able to stream in with Chromecast.

Last but not least, comes PlayOn, a service that combines several popular content-streaming platforms in one easy-to-use service. Although you have to install PlayOn to your computer and pay a fee to join the service, you will have access to 60 different video-streaming services, including Amazon Instant Video, EPSN, Comedy Central, Adult Swim, SyFy and Hulu. PlayOn for Chromecast is still in beta, but the mobile app should arrive soon with Chromecast support.
